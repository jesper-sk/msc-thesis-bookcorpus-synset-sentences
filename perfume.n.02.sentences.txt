leaning back , i examined the finished product.as normal , she was beautiful.her perfume was delicate , yet distinct.no one else in the world smelled like she did- she had perfume makers custom make her scent.her slender arms were adorned with jeweled arm cuffs , her ears were decorated with large golden earrings.her obsidian eyes , as black as night , met mine in the mirror.hers were twinkling .
as the breeze blew over me , i caught a whiff of my own scent and pulled my wrist to my nose so that i could inhale it.one of the many things the egyptians had gotten right was their mastery of perfume oils.i had never smelled as feminine as i did right now.it was subtle , soft and exquisite .
she nodded absently and i watched in the flickering candlelight as she rubbed her perfume oil lightly into the skin of her neck , arms and wrists.she started to put the little jar away and then added a dab to her cl**vage as an afterthought .

the worst case i 'd ever seen had been a soap - bubble thin ornamental glass perfume bottle ; it was stored in the wardens association vault in the u.n . building in new york , because that thing would shatter if you so much as gave it a hard look .

as if it were nt bad enough that shed lost the costume earrings shed been planning to wear , dropped the glass bottle of perfume shed appropriated from carlotta ( she was practically gagging from the power of the scent , and shed already cut her foot in two places ) , and her hair was an absolute disaster , she could nt find a costume that was half - decent , in her size , and that she had nt worn on an evening with raoul already .

she hummed a little more as she took the perfume bottle and dabbed a little of the lavender scent on her neck and her wrists .
