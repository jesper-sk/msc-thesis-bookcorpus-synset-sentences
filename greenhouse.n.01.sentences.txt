gardeners tended greenhouses full of trees and flowers , but most of the citizens of the whisperward lived on cactus , crickmeal and fence lizards .
still , the greenhouse walls were only made of glass and our dreameater potentially a whitefinger one had made spectacularly short work of them .
i strapped my ' bow across my back and after a moment 's consideration , tucked the piece of lace from the greenhouse into a pocket .
there were street sweepers , cleaners who kept the greenhouse glass sparkling clear , water carriers who took buckets from the wells to the plants , couriers who carried messages between important people , freighters who carted meat in from the scale farms , as well as cloth and other supplies that could not be grown or made in the houses .
the boy shot a terrified look back over his shoulder and almost smashed into the corner of a greenhouse as he darted down a side path .
the blackthumbs were running to help him and then the greenhouse just exploded .
` ` liam said he saw a whitefinger in the greenhouse , '' i interrupted .
if i had an orchid for every time a criminal said a whitefinger did it , i 'd have my own greenhouse . ''
it was snagged on a piece of glass , which means it was caught or placed there after the greenhouse was shattered .
i wondered if anyone felt that way about the shards of glass from byron 's greenhouse i frowned in the darkness .
byron 's greenhouse .
the roads of angel city had become camps , with tents sprung up like greenhouse seedlings , choking the streets with people trying to carve out a place of their own in this last refuge .
we trade some for things we want and the rest we germinate in early spring out in the greenhouse .
` ` the garden and the greenhouse are on the other side of the trees , '' avon explained .
minutes later she entered the greenhouse .
after a few educational trips to the graviton energy fields and the orbital greenhouse labs they started missing home and daydreamed about the enticing patterns of the ocean currents and the chocolate raspberry sunrises with shiny metallic containers bedazzling the sky .
` ` yes , your lounge , your private greenhouse , your garden , your research lab and your vr room , '' the building clarified .
` ` permanent suites , guest suites , classrooms , laboratories , libraries , archives and reading areas , auditoria , music studios , storage and utilities , greenhouse units , '' the building enumerated .
` ` why the greenhouse ?
sister joseph used the garden path and the suite as a shortcut from the prayer hall to the greenhouses ; she had requested a variety of cold and dry climate wildlife and populated the institute 's deserts , taigas and tundras .
the science delegation from earth 's orbital greenhouse was there one day early and sarah ran over the details in her mind to make sure the institute was ready for their arrival .
the original idea was to keep her in one of the desert greenhouse environments but josephine did n't take well to being confined and screeched their ears off until they let her out to the absolute delight of the children , visitors and science delegations and the chagrin of sarah for whom protecting the crops became a full time occupation .

i ' ve tested it on the plants we ' ve got growing in the greenhouse . ''
some buildings had grown over the park , blocking the sun and poisoning the air , so that a complicated greenhouse dome was necessary to keep the trees and plants breathing .
` ` i 'd rather harvest apples and cherries than work in the greenhouses . ''
when we stepped into the closest greenhouse my heart sank .
as we neared the first table in the first greenhouse , i felt something .
so i knew that the plants in that greenhouse were in trouble and that trouble was worse than wilkes zander had intimated .
we went to the other side of the main room , into a second greenhouse .
they were fine and once i was back home in new rochelle i 'd try to figure out a way to help the poor plants in the greenhouses without appearing to do so .
the head grower left us alone as cullen half - dragged me between the rows of tables to still a third greenhouse filled with tomato plants .
the greenhouse workers would think that and they 'd know they 'd come close to hexing the head of security 's girl friend .
we said a pleasant goodbye to their glowering faces and exited the greenhouse , still with our arms wrapped around each other .
i promised that fake dirt that i 'd figure out what was wrong with the plants in the greenhouses and i 'd fix it .
from the greenhouse .
` ` the greenhouses are full of dead and dying plants . ''
` ` come to the greenhouse .
but , as the head grower pointed out , though the plants in the greenhouse were still sickly , the rest of the crops on the destiny were vibrant and so heavy with abundance that the workers were having a hard time keeping up .
they suggested we wait until they had the greenhouse back to normal before taking our tour .
they told us we 'd be disappointed because they 'd been too busy outside the greenhouses to attend to the plants inside .
he put the tomato plant back and led the way to the other greenhouses .
by the time we 'd gone through every greenhouse and were finishing the circle that brought us back to the offices , the captain was a believer .
the greenhouse personnel were expecting me when cullen and i walked through the door but the only person who acknowledged me was the head grower and his expression would have killed me if possible .
i came from an influential family in the greenhouse business .
we were in the bowels of the greenhouse complex , passing through one building with no growing plants in it but boxes and barrels of what looked like chemicals .
we laughed and made our way carefully around a few prickly pear cacti to still another greenhouse filled with small trees .
then , smiling again so i 'd know that at least one person in the greenhouses was my friend , he left and i went to find the chasteberry tree that wouldor would not help darlene smithers become pregnant .
` ` come to the main greenhouse .
by the time saul reached the first greenhouse and let me know that there was no one waiting outside , i 'd cleaned up and was no longer shaking .
but i still made my way carefully , looking ahead before entering each greenhouse , until i was in the main room .
saul said nothing to the other greenhouse workers about the incident so no one sent odd looks my way though constance reiwer did intercept a look between saul and myself and pursed his lips .
` ` finish the week in the greenhouses , then go back to your trees . ''
then he headed out the front door and i went to the nursery at the back of the greenhouse complex .
then we headed for the main greenhouse where saul would give his report .
while still deep in the bowels of the greenhouse complex , where there was no easy entrance or exit , we heard a sound .
the greenhouses depended mostly on grow lights spaced throughout the various buildings so as to provide perfect conditions for plants with differing light requirements .
we do n't usually have visitors at the greenhouse . ''
it arced high in the air but i was running full out and it fell behind me as i reached the door to the next greenhouse , one filled with plants .
but the sound of shattering glass and the heat that swept through the greenhouse i was in told me what had happened .
as the explosions died away , the fire began and the entire greenhouse complex became a flaming torch so hot that even the carefully controlled humidity evaporated as the devastation moved from one house to the next , following me as i ran , catching up to me before i reached safety .
after what seemed like hours and was probably minutes , the smoke cleared and we could see the main greenhouse ahead .
pure , fresh air made by the plants that made up the farm that was the spaceship destiny as i explained to cullen what had just happened and who the men were who 'd set the greenhouses on fire .
but there had only been a half dozen men in the greenhouse .
` ` those men who came after you in the greenhouses did n't survive the fire , which is a good thing because it saves me the bother of punishing them . ''
the captain gazed into the distance at the still smoldering wreckage of the greenhouse complex .
i could see my greenhouse at the end of my small field and on its glass roof a gray shaggy looking cat was staring back at me .
there was a small greenhouse halfway down a winding path to the secluded beach , where a little sailboat was tethered up above the high tide line .

everyday , a constant flurry of activity occurred in and around the greenhouse , arboretum and adjacent lab .
it was still too cold on the surface for human life , but you could actually live comfortably under the greenhouse domes and in the towers that rose up above the domes in its largest city .
the greenhouse effect .
` ` once identified , '' i continue , ` ` the problem was compounded by willful shifting '' ` ` which was further compounded by the upswing in greenhouse gas emissions on earth . ''
every once in a while i 'll hear news stories about another greenhouse gas reducing initiative by our government or by another elsewhere in the world and i cluck my tongue and shake my head at the futility of it all .
they also banned any process that created greenhouse gasses .
and i ' m all for reducing our emissions of greenhouse gasses to zero as well .
julia giggled like a little girl as the owl swung from the corner of the greenhouse .

as much as i hated blood , and even though i was a total wimp when it came to pain , i pulled out my knife and sliced my arm so deep , a torrent of red poured onto the rocks just in front of the greenhouse , which was by then doubling as the second infirmary , because it was where the medical records and inventory lists had been stored even before the bombing .
i mean , this huge puddle of blood in the alley right beside the greenhouse , but no blood drops on any of the paths leading up to the greenhouse at all .

the loss of the greenhouse gas meant inferno could retain less and less heat .
theory said the dust injection would be of benefit to the climate in the long run , an aid to the efforts to adjust the planetary greenhouse factor , but it also meant there would be a prolonged period of bad weather .
they were in the small greenhouse attached to his study .
she turned away from him as patrin entered the far end of the greenhouse .
oh , he had built this greenhouse , but the study there had been her private room .
` ` that is not adequate , '' einarsson said , ` ` because the implication of this paragraph is that we are observing the effects of global warming from greenhouse gases .
but in fact , global warming is the theory that increased levels of carbon dioxide and certain other gases are causing an increase in the average temperature of the earth 's atmosphere because of the so - called greenhouse effect . ' ''
` ` the theory of global warming predicts that the upper atmosphere will warm from trapped heat , just like a greenhouse .
as i understand it , global warming is caused by an increase in so - called greenhouse gases , such as carbon dioxide , that trap heat in the earth 's atmosphere and prevent it from escaping into space .
` ` so , according to the theory , '' jennifer said , ` ` the atmosphere itself gets warmer , just as it would inside a greenhouse ? ''
` ` and these greenhouse gases affect the entire planet . ''
urbanization versus greenhouse gases as the cause of the increased average surface temperature .
we expect the defense to argue like this : ladies and gentlemen of the jury , you ' ve all heard the claim that something called global warming ' is occurring because of an increase in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
and methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide . ''
if you read some authors who say , we find that anthropogenic greenhouse gases and sulphates have had a detectable influence on sea - level pressure ' it sounds like they went into the world and measured something .

when jace opened the greenhouse door , the scent hit clary , soft as the padded blow of a cat 's paw : the rich dark smell of earth and the stronger , soapy scent of night - blooming flowers - moonflowers , white angel 's trumpet , four - o'clocks - and some she did n't recognize , like a plant bearing a star - shaped yellow blossom whose petals were medallioned with golden pollen .
the stone floor of the greenhouse was cold against her skin , but it was pleasant after so many days of relentless heat .
much as he 'd pretended to be fine up in the greenhouse , his whole body still ached from the beating it had taken last night .
` ` jace is up in the greenhouse if you want to see him , '' he said .
the greenhouse was just as she 'd remembered it , though the sky above the glass roof was sapphire now .
she found jace sitting on the marble bench in the middle of the greenhouse .
the driveway circled the flower bed and led past two greenhouses - one for tropical foliage , the other for desert species - and the a - frame house .
say , want to see my greenhouse ?
they were coming from the direction i was heading and they became louder with each step i took towards the greenhouse .
the greenhouse came into view , but only one figure was waiting for me , glaring their disdain at me like i was a parasite .
i rushed behind the greenhouse , desperate to find him .
meet me at the greenhouse . ''
this greenhouse is one of his rooms , perhaps his favorite ; perhaps in better times he tended the plants himself .
shriveled and fragile , but holding on to that unnatural perfection cultivated in snow 's greenhouse .
he does not think god will love us because we are good , but that god will make us good because he loves us ; just as the roof of a greenhouse does not attract the sun because it is bright , but becomes bright because the sun shines on it .
the ; impression , caught out of the corner of his eye , had been that of a greenhouse roof with the sun on it .
there was a kind of path up the middle ( as it might be in a greenhouse ) , and along each side at intervals stood rich suits of armour , like knights guarding the treasures .
` ` i ' ve a couple of tomatoes in there mick 's wife gave me from her little greenhouse .
she found the shield - and oh my god , a work of art it was , hanging in the earthy , herby - smelling greenhouse .
like greenhouse flowers starting to rot .
part iv the greenhouse trenton trenton had n't been inside the greenhouse in years and was startled by the bird : as soon as trenton closed the pantry door it rose , flapping , to the sky , so close that trenton could feel the air shredded beneath its big , black wings .
part iv the greenhouse trenton trenton had n't been inside the greenhouse in years and was startled by the bird : as soon as trenton closed the pantry door it rose , flapping , to the sky , so close that trenton could feel the air shredded beneath its big , black wings .
the greenhouse he remembered was a jungle , a riot of flowers as big as a child 's head , trembling with moisture , humid and exotic and totally off - limits .
there was no longer anything green in the greenhouse , except for a dozen fake plants - squat christmas trees with plastic bristles , fabric lilies , improbable plastic orchids , and even a miniature palm tree - crammed into one corner of the rectangular space .
he did n't know which but he knew : someone had just entered the greenhouse .
the words came to him , a faint , dry rustle on the wind that lifted and turned the leaves scattered on the greenhouse floor .
his first thought was that another lightbulb had exploded , but then he remembered there were no lightbulbs in the greenhouse .
minna 's voice , muffled through the thick glass walls , came to him ; then she was shoving into the greenhouse from the garden , using her shoulder .
caroline burst through the door that connected the greenhouse to the pantry , wearing nothing but a thin bathrobe , open , over her nightgown .
she heard minna 's called greeting and a burst of overlapping voices , then footsteps , crossing back toward the greenhouse .
for the first time since entering the greenhouse caroline saw , suddenly , what it had become : the sad plastic simulacrum , the withered plants crying out for water , the boxes of old christmas decorations and dirty wooden shelves , still imprinted with watermarks and ghostly rings where flowerpots and planters had once stood .
richard had left the greenhouse to die .
minna reenters the greenhouse , flushed , excited .
minna stops when she finds the greenhouse empty .
` ` i ' m investigating a disappearance , '' he says , and for just one second , minna and caroline , the greenhouse , the whole house - us , me - seem to vanish , and all i feel is that tiny pulsing presence , the new ghost , drumming like a heartbeat .
then they 're gone , and caroline and minna are left standing together in the greenhouse , surrounded by dead and rotting things .
trenton 's been slinking around outside , spying , because the cops are n't gone three minutes before he sticks his head back into the greenhouse .
sometimes on hot days i 'd go to the store just to bend down and put my face over the lettuce and inhale , let the water hit the back of my neck and shoulders , and pretend i was nothing but a cabbage , or a flower in a greenhouse - with nothing to do but be cared for .
maybe that 's why caroline was so crazy about her greenhouse .
he had left the window open in his bedroom , then partially lowered the blinds , trying to replicate the quality of the light in the greenhouse .
trenton crossed over to her and grabbed the back of her jacket - his jacket , he realized , which he 'd left at her house last night - too angry even to be impressed by the fact she 'd managed to drag the ladder all the way from the greenhouse .
trenton remembered the first time he had seen eva 's ghost in the greenhouse - the dry rustle of her voice , like autumn leaves tumbling over a barren riverbed .
chapter 3 the next morning , dean was in the greenhouse comparing the list of miss kirkes favourite flowers with the young plants he had grown from seed .
what were you doing in the greenhouse , mr . dean ?
she followed him along the gravel path , past the greenhouse , beyond the shrubbery , and down a path that led into a wilderness hollow .
he is often to be found in the greenhouse at this hour .
dean took to heart the grizzled ladys advice and apologized to andrew before he returned to his greenhouse retreat .
mr . dean has written it on a piece of paper that he left in the greenhouse .
it was like a greenhouse .
the couple wended near the wooden - framed greenhouse , draped with linen and nightshades violet flowers .
he continued only a few more steps to the greenhouse .
once inside the greenhouses perfumes of purple rose , red poppy and blue lotus , khufus legs weakened .
moments passed before khufu remembered himself in the greenhouse , no longer staring at his gray mask but hearing isiss heavenly lullabies and inhaling the bloom of figs in boiling cream .
the next midnight , a full day for khufu to stagnate due to the slow inundation and meritates dam against theormis balm , he walked between the gardens rose bushes and the greenhouse reflecting on their walk here .
upon his command , a procession of servants collected and carried from the greenhouse into his suite bunches of pink roses , yellow - centered daisies , red poppies and the blue lotus .
since their first formal meeting , theormi had helped chief taharqa chart irrigation canals and wells using their local control of access to the travel sea , stockpile millet and dried dates as well as construct a greenhouse .
past sycamores posed like dancers , the two slipped into the greenhouse , breathing in the sweet humidity .
for each experiment a number of pot plants were placed during the blooming period in a greenhouse , to serve as control plants [ see footnote ] for the main experiment ... '' the data and the details droned on and on .
for example , although his audience probably went to sleep as he tried to explain it , his use of the indoor results ( carried out in a greenhouse ) to dismiss certain outdoor results made it possible to attribute anomalous behavior to the work of beetles ( which also enjoy a good meal of pollen ) .
i do n't understand if the sudden stoppage of all the greenhouse gases we had been producing has anything to do with this .
before the madness struck , people had been worried about the greenhouse effect .
the problem of too much pollution and factories and power plants spitting out greenhouse gases has been basically eliminated .

the greenhouse metalwork wall frames and roof trusses were due to be delivered from the factory where they were being prefabricated by the end of the following week after which the glazing could go ahead .
as well , there would be a rear doorway let through the new wall into the greenhouse , with another two internal gates set in the central spur wall that would divide the garden into unequal halves .
