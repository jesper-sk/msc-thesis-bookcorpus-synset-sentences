the diarrhea contained millions of cholera organisms ; it would run into the water supply and infect others in the village .
under those circumstances , the epidemic evolved to a milder form , enabling the victim to walk around and spread the milder organisms by contact , dirty linens , and so on .
apparently the parent that awakened the offspring expels protein - rich mucus through its pores , which the progeny ingests until it is old enough to digest more complex organisms like vegetable matter and insects . ''

it is an undeniable fact that complex organisms are rare on earth , while simple organisms flourish in abundance .
it is an undeniable fact that complex organisms are rare on earth , while simple organisms flourish in abundance .
simple creatures are much more common than complex organisms .
my own calculations , indicated earlier in the paper , consider the relative abundance of different organisms throughout the universe .
that probability is as follows : form : probability unicellular organisms or less ( naked genetic in formation ) : .7840 multicellular organisms , simple : .1940 multicellular organisms , complex but lacking coordinated central nervous system : .0140 multicellular organisms with integrated organ systems including nervous system : .0018 multicellular organisms with complex nervous system capable of handling 7 + data ( human capability ) : .0002 total : 1.0000 * * * these considerations lead me to believe that the first human interaction with extraterrestrial life will consist of contact with organisms similar to , if not identical to , earth bacteria or viruses .

previous to stone 's paper , most discussion of contamination dealt with the hazards to other planets of satellites and probes inadvertently carrying earth organisms .
he stated that it was equally possible for extraterrestrial organisms to contaminate the earth via space probes .
the consequence of this is the potential introduction of virulent organisms into the present terrestrial ecologic framework .
once the laboratory was finished , it only remained to select the wildfire alert team , the group of scientists who would study any new organism .
its avowed aim was the collection of any organisms that might exist in ` ` near space , ` ` the upper atmosphere of the earth .
in theory , jpl was designing a satellite to enter the fringes of space and collect organisms and dust for study .
in final form , scoop was a program to orbit seventeen satellites around the earth , collecting organisms and bringing them back to the surface .
unfortunately , it was found to contain only standard earth organisms .
scoops iv and v were recovered intact from the indian ocean and the appalachian foothills , but neither contained radically new organisms ; those collected were harmless variants of s. albus , a common contaminant of normal human skin .
it was found to contain a previously unknown form of unicellular organism , coccobacillary in shape , gram - negative , coagulase , and triokinase - positive .
` ` eat the meat of infected people , and carry the organisms away with them . ''
it called for the placement of a limited thermonuclear weapon at the site of exposure of terrestrial life to exogenous organisms .
replaced in 1966 when upjohn developed filters capable of trapping organisms of size up to one micron .
should breakthrough of the organism occur , with contamination of all level v , detonation will take place within three minutes unless you lock in your key , and call it off . ''
his own research with staphylococcus , for example , had shown that this organism produced two enzymes that altered blood .
but it did n't help them in finding out how the scoop organism worked .
* * * leavitt , the clinical microbiologist , was thinking through the steps in isolation and identification of the causative organism .
they would be hoping like hell to come up with an organism that they could work with , experiment on , and identify .
men knew this , but they somehow assumed that the lethal effects of the disease were unrelated to the diarrhea ; they searched for something else : an antidote , a drug , a way to kill the organism .
but leavitt wondered about the scoop organism .
as organisms became more intelligent , they grew larger , passing from the single - celled stage to multicellular creatures , and then to larger animals with differentiated cells working in groups called organs .
the arguments and counter - arguments were complex , but boiled down to a simple substrate : whenever a worker would announce that he had found a fossil , or a proteinaceous hydrocarbon , or other indication of life within a meteorite , the critics would claim sloppy lab technique and contamination with earth - origin matter and organisms .
he found that they were ring - shaped organisms , rather like a tiny undulating inner tube , and he found they could grow and multiply .
he became discouraged and set his work with meteorites aside ; the organisms were later destroyed in an accidental laboratory explosion on the night of june 27 , 1963 .
the first was the most obvious -- an organism , from another planet or galaxy , which had the protection to survive the extremes of temperature and vacuum that existed in space .
there was no doubt that organisms could survive -- there was , for instance , a class of bacteria known as thermophilic that thrived on extreme heat , multiplying enthusiastically in temperatures as high as 70deg c. further , it was known that bacteria had been recovered from egyptian tombs , where they had been sealed for thousands of years .
this shell enabled the organism to survive freezing or boiling , and , if necessary , thousands of years without food .
these organisms might also be capable of direct conversion of energy to matter .
and if there were organisms out there , and if they had departed from the baking crust of the earth long before the first men appeared , then they would be foreign to man .
this was contemporary earth organisms , taken into space by inadequately sterilized spacecraft .
once in space , the organisms would be exposed to harsh radiation , weightlessness , and other environmental forces that might exert a mutagenic effect , altering the organisms .
once in space , the organisms would be exposed to harsh radiation , weightlessness , and other environmental forces that might exert a mutagenic effect , altering the organisms .
take up a harmless bacteria -- such as the organism that causes pimples , or sore throats -- and bring it back in a new form , virulent and unexpected .
` ` the satellite was scheduled for a six - day orbit , since the probability of collecting organisms is proportional to time in orbit .
in the case of the black norwegian , it was now possible for a scientist anywhere in the world to conduct experiments using this animal and be assured that other scientists elsewhere could repeat or enlarge upon his work using virtually identical organisms .
first the organism had to be found .
main control was set up to find the organism .
at piedmont , he and stone had been concerned about a gas , perhaps a gas released as waste from the living organism .
using a remotely controlled scalpel , he sliced open the dead animal further , to make sure any organisms contained inside the carcass would be released into the atmosphere .
these last are not minor diseases , but they are much less severe than they once were , because both man and organism have adapted . ''
this meant that the chances of an organism from outer space being suited to harm man were very slim .
but it was not really adapted to men , because it killed and died within the organism .
the question remained -- how did the organisms get into the body ?
possibly the organisms burrowed right through the skin surface .
he knew that the organism killed by clotting blood .
then he exposed the rats to air containing the lethal organism .
dead organisms are not infectious .
presumably the organisms cross over to the bloodstream there -- or they may release a toxic substance , which crosses over .
stone said , ` ` could this acid have protected him from the organism ? ''
` ` something we believe may represent the organism , '' stone said .
` ` we think that 's our organism .
we thought it might be a single organism .
we 'll want an analysis of samples of both the rock and the green organism . ''
because they had no reason to believe that either the rock or the green organism was composed even partially of proteins .
the old definitions -- an organism that showed ingestion , excretion , metabolism , reproduction , and so on -- were worthless .
all living organisms in some way took in energy -- as food , or sunlight -- and converted it to another form of energy , and put it to use .
that would destroy airborne organisms , and neutralize the source of infection .
they could spend a month , even a year , working on the organism .
the house became a different organism altogether .
leavitt stated that they had an organism and that it required a code .
the transmission was as follows : open line to transmit understand transmit state origin stone project wildfire state destination central codes understand central codes message follows send have isolated extraterrestrial organism secondary to return of scoop seven wish coding for organism end message transmitted there followed a long pause .
the transmission was as follows : open line to transmit understand transmit state origin stone project wildfire state destination central codes understand central codes message follows send have isolated extraterrestrial organism secondary to return of scoop seven wish coding for organism end message transmitted there followed a long pause .
message from central codes follows understand isolation of new organism please characterize end message stone frowned .
however , the teleprinter was impatient : transmit reply to central codes after a moment , stone typed back : message to central codes follows can not characterize at this time but suggest tentative classification as bacterial strain end message message from central codes follows understand request for bacterial classification opening new category classification according to icda standard reference code for your organism will be andromeda code will read out andromeda filed under icda listings as 053.9 [ unspecified organism ] further filing as e866 [ aircraft accident ] this filing represents closest fit to established categories stone smiled .

it was hoped that these analyses would tell , in a rough way , how foreign the andromeda organism was to earth life forms .
and the green spot , presumably alive , was composed of elements in roughly the same proportion as earth life on earth , these same four elements -- hydrogen , carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen -- accounted for 99 per cent of all the elements in life organisms .
on earth , organisms had evolved by learning to carry out biochemical reactions in a small space , with the help of protein enzymes .
therefore , they were dealing with an entirely alien organism .
jeremy stone found himself staring at a single unit of the organism .
` ` to how this organism functions .
` ` the organism is made of hydrogen , carbon , oxygen , and nitrogen .
` ` you 're wondering if we 're seeing part of a higher organism ? ''
is this unit self - sufficient , like a bacterium , or is it just a block from a larger organ , or a larger organism ?
the organism would be self - replicating , cheap , and could be produced in fantastic numbers .
each single organism would carry the potential to develop into a full organ , or a full organism .
each single organism would carry the potential to develop into a full organ , or a full organism .
` ` but we already know the organism acts by clotting . ''
suppose that the organism acted by causing damage to blood vessels .
but if the damage was extensive , if it began at the lungs and worked its way ... ` ` i ' m wondering , '' hall said , ` ` if our organism attacks vessel walls .
but if clotting were prevented in certain persons , then the organism might eat away and cause hemorrhage in those persons . ''
and now there was an example of an organism that destroyed them preferentially .
` ` in most people , the organism begins clotting at the lungs .
but if coagulation is prevented , then the organism erodes through the vessels of the brain , and hemorrhage occurs . ''
` ` meaning that they somehow prevented the primary process , which is invasion of the organism into the vessel walls of the body .
the andromeda organism did n't get to the lungs , or the brain .
their first conclusion was that growth media did not matter at all -- the organism grew equally well on sugar , blood , chocolate , plain agar , or sheer glass .
the organism had no excretions .
this was an organism highly suited to its environment .
it is imperative : no atomic device must be detonated around the organisms .
local conditions within the colony change , and check the growth of organisms .
on the other hand , if you had an organism that was capable of directly converting energy to matter , and if you provided it with a huge rich source of energy , like an atomic blast ... ` ` i 'll pass along your recommendation to the president , '' robertson said .
* * * stone said , ` ` i think we 'd better check our cultured organisms for biologic potency . ''
they had to be careful the organism did n't mutate , did n't change to something radically different in its effects .
willis x - ray crystallography analysis showed that the andromeda organism was not composed of component parts , as a normal cell was composed of nucleus , mitochondria , and ribosomes .
the two men were at a loss to explain how so simple an organism could utilize energy for growth .
somehow , the drug acted to destroy all organisms , built on a unicellular structure , or less .
he had pointed out that mankind had , over centuries of exposure , developed a carefully regulated immunity to most organisms .
and you opened the way to superinfection , the problem of new organisms , bearing new diseases .
another man fell prey to an organism that ate away his stomach in a matter of hours .
what happened to the organism , when you were acidotic and breathing fast ?
perhaps fast breathing kept the organism from getting into your lungs long enough to penetrate to blood vessels .
the organism attacked through the lungs .
but in order to produce such rapid , severe damage , it would take many organisms .
if the medium for growth was too acid , the organism would not multiply .
` ` but the organism flourishes in carbon dioxide ! ''
when the child stopped crying , either the organism was no longer there - had been blown away , cleared from the air - or else the organism- '' ` ` changed , '' stone said .
` ` so burton is now exposed to a harmless organism .
` ` and if most mutations occur at times of multiplication , when the organism is growing most rapidly ... '' the sirens went off , and the computer flashed a message in red .
and if that bomb goes off , it 'll spread the organism all over the surface .
he breathed in the air of the lab , which was cool and fresh , and laced with andromeda organisms .
` ` according to predictions , the organism is over los angeles now . ''
` ` we have the organism , and can continue to study it .
it 's a rather astonishing organism in its versatility . ` `
` ` i think we can be fairly confident that the organism will move into the upper atmosphere without causing further difficulty on the surface , so there 's no problem there .

in this mathematical world of peaks and valleys , populations of organisms were seen to climb the fitness peaks , or slide down into the valleys of nonadaptation .
stu kauffman and his coworkers had shown that advanced organisms had complex internal constraints which made them more likely to fall off the fitness optima , and descend into the valleys .

let 's see , that adds up to- daylight rattled through the elegant hotel room , uncovering stately shapes which , joe chip blinkingly saw , were articles of furnishings : great hand - printed drapes of a neo - silkscreen sort that depicted man 's ascent from the unicellular organisms of the cambrian period to the first heavier - than - air flight at the beginning of the twentieth century .

alfred said , glad to see you boys started without me , do nt let me interrupt william , i want you and ben to assess 007s ability to support a v10x - based organism indefinitely .
can we move a functioning organism from one host to another ?
can 007 integrate the v10x functionality into his systems , extend himself , or just sustain the organism ?
i can deliver the electronic to bio organism cloning system for an additional sum , equal to the first .
i left you the tech guides and program source code for everything on the biomesh organism we gave you .
well the v10x is the most current version of the memory , and we just wanted to give you the best , said william , and you re correct in the basic inventory of the organism .
honestly , said jacob , i m just surprised how well the memory is working , but all the functions on the implant organism seem to be working fine too .
jacob said , we figured out how to grow bio organisms that duplicate electronics , maybe we can engineer the process in reverse , or just cover this up somehow .
i m afraid someone will want to remove the organism .
one million dollars us , a year , said victoria , plus ten percent of some undisclosed amount later , obviously after he sells to push william to finish the hs project and raise toby , keeping him involved in williams work , possibly including the bio organism project in the deal if that s possible without you .
yes , said william , i was shocked the other night when he described the capabilities of the organism and how he could use it .
alfred is dangling a bonus in front of ben and i to install an organism like tobys into 007 and get the two to work together , said william .
the organism is self - sustaining as long as it has power .
bens been saying something about genetics and fuel cells for the power , but getting 007 to use the full capacity of the organism will be a challenge .
much of the energy harvesting and electronic circuitry can be directly ported to bio organisms .
the ability to power and utilize these organisms directly within the human brain is a reality .
once powered , these organisms are completed self - contained with advances in the understanding of neural molecular processes , gene and protein sequencing maps , we have integrated higher brain functions with manmade logic gates your father dreamed of these things victoria cried .
toby furrowed his eyebrows , recalling the glances between victoria and william when he described how he could use the organism .
ben pickerington and i built a system to grow electronic logic gates into self - sustained bio organisms , converting electronic system - on - a - chip technologies , like your v10x , into living logic organisms .
ben pickerington and i built a system to grow electronic logic gates into self - sustained bio organisms , converting electronic system - on - a - chip technologies , like your v10x , into living logic organisms .
getting a human to accept the organism and use a significant portion of its capacity is a long - term proposition .
it is an interesting challenge , said ben , the electrical power 007 provides is almost adequate to support the organism .
i think a way to amplify the power needs to either be added to 007 or become part of the organism .
when you and william think the power issues are ironed out on paper , well see about cloning another v10x organism , said alfred .
its great ; our first real success with an organism , said ben uncomfortably , clearing his throat .
by the way , said jacob , did alfred ever get over his aversion to our terms used to describe growing the organisms ?
shortly after the sale , said jacob , alfred told me that my bioengineering work , the memory organism , was being implanted in nursing home patients and orphans without consent theirs or mine .
he fit the bill perfectly for a v10x organism , he needed the short - term memory , and if it could be integrated with his higher brain functions he would lead a more normal life .
i think he wants to sell the hs units , the bio organism growing methods , toby , everything .
i think there will be more interest in harvesting tobys organism than kidnapping and brainwashing him , victoria said solemnly .
alfred has already asked you and ben to research transplanting an operational organism between hosts .
alfred has asked me to design an electrical system interface to allow a v10x organism to survive indefinitely in an hs , but the hs power system is inadequate and needs a boost , said ben .
pushing memories to bio organisms is the right direction .
everything we ve manufactured so far has a known limit , but the organisms are simulating natural neural networks .
it is commendable , but elementary compared to the intelligence modules and the organism growing technology , said toby .
its going to take some time , and of course well need another v10x organism ultimately .
we will also be able to implant the newly - cloned organism into the hs , where it will be fully functional .
an interesting feat if the organism remains stable .
you have successfully implanted an organism in a young boy .
he just agreed to give away 007 , the genetic growth equipment and process , a demo clone which means that barbarian is getting human tissues implant the new organism in 007 and turn over toby to those savages .
ahmad replied with equal coolness , i have come here as dr . alfred harlands guest to witness the electronic to bio organism cloning technique you perfected , dr . crawford , and to collect the fruit of my investments .
unknown to everyone , it was frank , posing as a foreign intelligence agent , who convinced alfred to turn toby over to victoria crawford , to nurse him through the bio organism implant , hopefully accelerating the research .
' probably , because the ape 's would be far simpler than those of the higher organism . '
that also includes single cell organisms such as the archaea , bacteria , and protists .
the trace of the plasmoid legacy tipped the balance toward the acquisition of will to occur within the organism the euglenoids occupied this gave them the upper hand and the sense to move away from conditions which threatened the familiarity of its surroundings or indeed to move closer to those surroundings which might be more beneficial to its survival .
we have millions of micro organisms living inside each of our bodies , helping to perpetuate our existence , keeping our systems in balance , keeping the elements within us in balance .
he was amazed at how intricate this organism was .
it was like a living organism , and the veiled had been an invading virus .
doctor hartman chuckles , i am a biosynthetic organism , of course i need nourishment .
i so wanted to join your little club and fly around the galaxy at the whim and fancy of pesky little bipedal organisms !
by the way , i am a biosynthetic organism but i obtain nutrition from a more synthetic source , my mouth and stomach , as you put it , does not serve the same purpose as yours does .
i d rather die than live as a lesser being among inferior organisms , solendria curses through clenched teeth .

we readily admit we previously took humans unwillingly and used them for sustenance and were sorry , well , as sorry as we can be for using another organism to provide life for our next generation .
the organism is unique , still very young , and so has none of its own .
the organisms body squirmed , tightening further , then viciously snapped back into shape like a giant elastic band .
that weird night this delicate haze engulfed the whole of each organism .
and remember , many others survival depends only on ours , in the same way every organism on earth is connected , each co dependent on each other to fulfil its potential .
you see , when the proper digits hold on to each other , i think its possible for two people to become one organism , linked forever in a small embrace that transcends mortality .
would bits and pieces of our cultures from earth still remain , carried forward like snippets of common dna into the organisms of the future ?
we all moved as one organism .
they were virtually independent organisms , and it seemed like they were playing two separate songs that were similar , yet , fundamentally different .
the high school definition of alive is that an organism must eat , reproduce , move , respire and all of those things they actually do !
a living organism must pass the following checklist to be considered alive in medical and biological terms .
they can not grow , do not maintain themselves against entropy , and do not reproduce as an organism .
the red lit room pulsated from the bass , giving the whole space the sense of a living organism with a single heartbeat , and making it very appealing to its members .
yes , i draft every individuals life from the moment of conception , from humans , all the way down to the tiniest microscopic organisms .
well its a kind of food arrangement in nature where organisms lower down in the pyramid support those on top .

copper is essential to all living organisms for respiratory .
did proteins and organisms make the stones and if so , where did those come from as well ?
were atoms , the building blocks of life , always here and one day , on a whim , just decided to form proteins and organisms that would eventually start intelligent life ?
with the destruction of our civilization imminent , we know someday in the distant future whatever damage we caused will eventually heal because the earth is a very resilient organism when left to recover without interference .
this was the tree of good fortune , after all , a living organism that had likely seen hundreds of years itself .

as onozawa headed north within the forest , the drop in pressure cooled the air with the moist wind and the climate calmed him with a sense of being within a limitless organism .
a living organism .
they began screaming in a strange , guttural tongue , and the sounds drifted and intermingled while passing over the water ; from the boat , it was as if a huge , frightfully alien organism shouted at them from a distance .
we see various organisms with differing characteristics .
any small advantage that an organism might havethe ability to run away quickly from predators , coloring that allows it to hide from predators , physical adaptations that allow it to gather food more easilywill give it an edge over other organisms , bettering its odds of winning the struggle over others and surviving .

natural selection is the process by which the best organism , the most fitted for survival , is preserved , and all the weaker ones are eliminated .
first , they can simply survive and live longer than other organisms .
second , they can leave more offspring than other species do , ensuring that their traits will be passed on to subsequent generations more frequently than will the traits of organisms that reproduce less .
these methods of perpetuation are interrelated : an organism that survives over others is also more likely to produce more offspring in its longer span of life .
the struggle for existence , then , is not just about individual survival ; it is about the survival of groups of related organisms over other groups .
organisms are related through the variations they share , and it is the advantages these variations give to the group that allow them to survive over other organisms .
organisms are related through the variations they share , and it is the advantages these variations give to the group that allow them to survive over other organisms .
as advantageous variations are naturally selected and become perpetuated through successive generations , organisms carrying these advantageous variations will diverge from the original species , eventually becoming a species of their own .
as these original organisms multiplied in subsequent generations , their descendents migrated throughout the world .
suddenly there were barriers such as oceans and mountain ranges that restricted the ability of organisms to migrate , and the few that managed to do so played a large role in shaping the evolution of species on islands and in geographically isolated areas .
for example if we look at kliev and all of the regions to the east of cuyamonga we see a population of organisms that prostituted their pure blood with that of lower beings and the result has been a population of mutants whose very ideas are a perversion of thought .
true , these organisms have accumulated a semblance of order and have grabbed at power but this is just a residual ambition carried over from the once pure blood .
if left unrestrained it will keep pushing until the fleshly organism breaks down and both the mind and body are destroyed .
however in order to avoid the mind being pushed too far in one direction and damaging the body of the organism it is then necessary to pull it in the opposite direction .
nature has given every part of the living organism a built in list of rules on how to develop .
if ignored the rebellious mass of cells , which refused to be bound by the rules of nature , will continue to grow until the entire organism is destroyed .
eventually they too will be destroyed since they can not live without the organism .
this man or woman feels the interconnected , the subtle play of their own organism .
a person can look through a lens into an infinitesimal new world full of tiny organisms .
our scientists believe those small organisms can enter a wound , take over the body , and destroy it .
we have learned to eliminate those organisms .
his skin turned green , and a symbiont , said dr . aobija , is an organism that lives in or on another organism ; in that it is like a parasite .
his skin turned green , and a symbiont , said dr . aobija , is an organism that lives in or on another organism ; in that it is like a parasite .
but they add that the symbiont will eagerly devour tarsanian gnomic paper , while the organism that causes torella - nor syndrome has no interest in it !
the organism ate the paper ?
and here is the reason : the symbiont is actually not a single animal or plant , but a whole ecosystem of organisms , all of which are too small to see !
when they became aware of the paper , some of those organisms rushed onto it and began devouring it , reproducing madly at the same time .
as each tiny organism became full , it laid between 50 and 70 eggs per breath .
these organisms are red - that s what the red color was , that you saw !
the teeth and digestive system were made for the usual human food ; but given a day or two to adjust , they could also handle grass , wood , plankton , topsoil , seawater , or anything that any other organism could eat .

her legs moved apart and her wings folded around him and he felt like they 'd merged into a single organism .
the idea was that , just as all bodies are governed by the law of gravitation , and organisms by biological laws , so the creature called man also had his lawcwith this great difference , that a body could not choose whether it obeyed the law of gravitation or not , but a man could choose either to obey the law of human nature or to disobey it .
as an organism , he is subjected to various biological laws which he can not disobey any more than an animal can .
they mean that christ is actually operating through them ; that the whole mass of christians are the physical organism through which christ acts - that we are his fingers and muscles , the cells of his body .
christians are christ 's body , the organism through which he works .
our ancestors have handed over to us organisms which are warped in this respect : and we grow up surrounded by propaganda in favour of unchastity .
( 2 ) the idea that the whole human race is , in a sense , one thing - one huge organism , like a tree - must not be confused with the idea that individual differences do not matter or that real people , tom and nobby and kate , are somehow less important than collective things like classes , races , and so forth .
things which are parts of a single organism may be very different from one another : things which are not , may be very alike .
on the other hand when you are tempted not to bother about someone else 's troubles because they are ' no business of yours , ' remember that though he is different from you he is part of the same organism as you .
if you forget that he belongs to the same organism as yourself you will become an individualist .

at fertilization , a mixture of the chromosomes from both types of cells became the contents of the newly formed zygote that eventually grew into a new organism .
phenotypes of even the simplest organisms on earth are extremely complicated .
classification of organisms into groups is an inexact science that is constantly changing and always being revised .
in the seventeenth century naturalists began trying to name living organisms , plants and animals , in some systematic way .
to get away from this confusion these naturalists used latin ( the language of culture and education at that time ) , and gave each plant or animal they could find a descriptive name that accurately said something about the organism .
he realized that all objects could be grouped ( note : in principle the system of classification devised by linnaeus could be applied to stamps , coins , chairs , cars , or almost anything , but we will restrict our discussion to living organisms ) .
for example , it was obvious to linnaeus that ` ` all living organisms '' represented one large group of objects , which could then be divided into two smaller groups ; ` ` plants '' and ` ` animals '' .
` ` plants '' and ` ` animals '' ) , and - deciding what factors determine where a particular organism is placed ( i.e .
although it seems obvious at the level of multicellular organisms that some are green ( plants ) and some move around ( animals ) , at the microscopic level some organisms are both green and move around !

after he had divided all organisms into two groups ( the ' kingdoms ' ) he took each kingdom and divided it up even further into smaller groups ( which he called ` ` phyla '' ) .
when defining the groups do you either , - try to make the groups as large as possible ( lumping as many organisms together as you can ) , or , - split the groups up into many small categories ( so as to make each group as unique as possible ) .
nomenclature in the system devised by linnaeus , the last two names used for each creature , the genus name and the species name , are put together to form the scientific name of that organism .
there is no denying the power of numbers and the impeccable arguments that derive from quantitative analysis , but abstract ratios on a notepad do n't seem to impress as much as having the living organism on the laboratory bench .

the illusion of movement gave natassia the eerie sensation that paul was stepping out of a nest of active veins , his pallor a foreign body within an otherwise healthy organism .
pieces of the carpet drifted across his legs , a rust coloured fluff that resembled clotted blood moving upstream through a massive organisms veins .
every biological organism that dies shits itself at the moment of its demise .
a disease is nothing more than a collection of organisms that your body does nt like .
virus is zoonotic , and infects virtually every multi - celled organism the same way , attacking the cell nucleus , overtaking it , assimilating it , reproducing it .
the endless stretch of rooms more resembled some extraterrestrial prison , or maybe purgatory , or cells in an organism .
they resemble female hormones in their chemical structure and effects on living organisms .
alexia valentine remained spellbound in the passenger seat , entranced in a state of inertia , every organism of her being was altering into a newly rooted malevolent perfection .
charlie was an extremophile - phile , the weirder and more resistant the organism the more excitable he became .
okay , how about this : think of the multiverse as an organism .
now in an organism , there s a defense system that cleans out cancer cells- but in the multiverse- well , there s none that we know of .
now , that the aberration had been identified as the annoying jashians , and not a pernicious organism , it was back to ignoring them again .
parasitic organisms that wormed their way into the brain via the liver ?
they fed on his dark experiences and the emotions they induced like parasitic organisms , tapping his spiritual energy in order to sustain theirs .
did you know that millions of years ago , the snails shell , as opposed to the mollusk inside , was the actual living organism ?
after a few moments , the organism swallowed her scaly form .
the principle of life , which makes organism , always remained , while the outward form changed .
just as the oneirophage preferred the more powerful dreams of living organisms , he knew also that appendages could become repositories and escape routes for dreams .
giant black tentacles reached out from the bestial spaceship and snatched organisms from caves and peaks and valleys , to be absorbed into the vessel through one of its myriad orifices and borne through its giant veins and arteries into chariah 's dungeons .
he held an entire universe in his mouth , within which he could taste everything from the galaxies and supernovas and black holes to every single droplet of every single ocean , every grain of sand and dirt on every planet , every single organism from demon to human to centaur to beast to cockroaches and their eggs , and then all the living parasites and all the viruses in every single one of those organisms .
he held an entire universe in his mouth , within which he could taste everything from the galaxies and supernovas and black holes to every single droplet of every single ocean , every grain of sand and dirt on every planet , every single organism from demon to human to centaur to beast to cockroaches and their eggs , and then all the living parasites and all the viruses in every single one of those organisms .
there were enlightenments to be gained from spiderflesh , and ten hecatombs of any organism was an offer he could not refuse in a universe which was becoming increasingly devoid of life .

it was difficult to know what nature of obligation that guni had had outstanding to anup , for there existed many species and sub - species thereofobligations which lived and breathed and roamed just as much as the hosts who bore them and which were , thus , inclined to biodifferentiate through adaptation in the same manner as any other parasitic organism .
it seemed conceivable that whatever it was that was occupying the space within the suitor conversely , whatever frame the suit had chosen to woreit was , in fact , an entity ( or the inverse thereof ) that visually appealed to ones recognition of its absence ( or in some cases , to ones disregard of its presence ) by means of abstract overtures which crescendoed to the undeniable inference that in some anti - matter , contrapositive space - time , there was most certainly a similar , visibly naked organism in a conversely inverse circumstance , who consisted only of legs , hands and a head , but no torso and who had want for nothing more than a purple tuxedo ( or , at the very least , one that was magenta ) .
protozoan architecture began to dot the landscape as the style was becoming a symbol of status amongst morells elite , largely due to the influence of groundbreaking avant garde designers such as vivek-13 and the zuzumebachi design group , who were renowned for the creation of aesthetic installations using only living organisms as building materials .

in actuality , the organisms on this planet are not complex enough yet to understand the concept of planets or solar systems or galaxies or what - have - you .
of course , in the lifespan of mankind , we will never have occasion to encounter these organisms firsthand , for they live on a planet too distant for us to reach and their ecosystem is , of course , extremely toxic .
in the absence of physical conflict , we are inclined to reflect more lastingly on the meaning and the value of life , not just in humankind , but often also in other organisms .
whatever the case , i found myself reflecting tearfully on the notion of ownershipof objects , of lands , of other organisms .
all the same , even this notion of common possession seemed to me rather arrogant , for the necessitated existence of a public domain was rooted in the shared human dominance over the objects or organisms in question .

in fact , industry and ambition are only ancillary to the main purpose of the organismthe main purpose being his own reproduction , and his species ability to provide nutrients for other organisms ; and the purpose for all species being the perpetuation of this very cycle .
ambition is a veil behind which dissatisfied organisms conceal disappointment at their own cosmic triviality : a veil allowing them to perpetuate , through self - serving delusion , the belief that there must be something worthwhile for which they have made themselves suffer .
and in fact there is nothing worthwhile for which these organisms must strive collectively ?
we must discard our prior assumptions about this moist - mouthed talker : he is not the nave and pitiful organism we thought he was .
the scabby and scrawny pierrot watches the fleshy , moneyed , self - important morsels and he cackles wondrously as he envisions the stealth of the approaching affliction which would liberate him from this interminable pain of diversion : rodents , mosquitoes , foaming cocker spaniels and mad roosters all scurrying through or flying amid the long grasses of the countryside , weaving through valleys , traversing swamps and rivers and wood toward the bustling metropolis , infecting all in their path with a fast - evolving , highly communicable pathogen which grows by migration and propagation in all directions and which devastates populations without ever stopping to consider its own status as a menace to humanity ( in fact , it knows not even of the existence of humanity , for it can not separate one nutrient - bearing organism from another , except perhaps by the subtleties of flavor , as to do so would require a discriminating sensitivity on the part of the microorganism : this might only occur within those predisposed to become connoisseurs of nutrient flavor and consistency over the course of their ultrashort life spans , which is a rare enough ability that one might be impelled to deem it a genetic abnormalitya mutation even ! but we shall not concern ourselves with such details just now ) .
the mayor continued with a plastered grin : and in his music he conveyed to all a message that has rung true in the hearts of every human , yamian or otherwise , since our very origins : that humankind shall prevail over the forces of nature which threaten us , that we shall , by every means at our disposal , obliterate those species which only seek to exploit us as hosts , that we shall otherwise tame all lesser organisms of our natural environment so that they would abide by our will always , for there is no other species more befitting of dominance over this ecosystem than our own !
the mayor continued : now , the scientists of our noble republic tell us there is a cure for red-17 just around the corner , and i must ask you all today to place your faith in them , and aid their efforts , for the cure they say is another organism , with which red-17 is a bitter rival .

every organism , if one were to consider it , which can not be done as anyone considering this is part of what is being considered , is unique and inherently precious but the fecundity of life established in the social contract of strife set up by the animals under duress in which all must be very fruitful so that some offspring will survive for the next generation and some will be the prey of predators for their sustenance .
it all makes terrestrial existence anything but home -- a world so far from the optimal that parents in greece and rome often had to abandon children so that they would die of exposure when infant mortality , normally expected , did not occur , making good fortune unsustainable.38 if it is absurd to think that every egg , sperm , and every skin cell chafed from the whole is holy so it is of the large organisms that these small processes comprise .
aus is one of my ballasts in a life needing stability , which is why aristotle says that a man who gives to a friend who does not have , in a friendship of inequality , has no reason to complain.68 chapter 13 delusions , dissimulation , and reconciliation the goal , stated or implied , contrived as it is when in fact i write in part to fill the vacuum of time in this violent red and yellow interregnum , remains to scrutinize the self in various lenses , distant and objective , myopic and personal , to determine whether in the present understanding of the accidents that brought about cosmology , the atomic structure of matter , the fruition of organisms , their evolvement , or in darwins words , descent with modification69 and by inference , consciousness as well ( the latter which could only arise from painful accidents that cause perplexity as to their origin , and because of language , more deliberate inquiry into them ) , any moral values can be determined unequivocally ; and if it is proven to the self , after a fair amount of inquiry to which giving even more time and scrutiny would seem ridiculous , that there is none , to deliberate on the best that man can realistically arrive at irrespective of his lack of purpose in the greater scheme of space and timeants that our scurrying around seem equivalent to as attested by any aerial view , as that from the top of the boyoke , and the absolute irrelevance a man , or even a society of men , to that which will come afterwards whose sense of now , if intelligent enough to ponder such questions of what was and will be , will , at best , relegate all earlier times to a vague belief in them having existed at all .
if man has volition , let alone a will for power70 this can be undermined by the macrocosm , the state , which can conscript men into soldiers , and from the war , an opposing army can cleft a society , and upset the foundation that a man predicates his life on ; and as for the microcosm , it can be assumed that a sperm cell racing against others to reach an egg , if there is one , or a white blood cell encroaching on the bacterial invader that will be its prey thinks of itself , no different than the entire organism , as autonomous , not knowing how it is being used by the larger macrocosm .
my goal is not to discuss the battles that will happen but , from personal experience , the battles that were , even though conflicts past , present , and future , in elements of the self , the self as a whole , and all things greater at least in scope , albeit perhaps not in purpose ( the smaller being more diffused than a grain of sand on the beach next to the latter but perhaps animals and human animals in particular having a unique consciousness that the universe lacks ) , seem part of the same war which , like sperm cells compelled into a marathon , are part of this natural coercion to cull and eliminate the weaker of competing alternatives of the smaller to form a more perfect nexus to the larger ( the cells to tissue , tissue to the organ , the organs to the organism , man to society , society to the ecosystem , the world of ecosystems to a solar system , the solar system to the galaxy , it to the universe that is one organ , perhaps , in this malevolent entity called god ) .
i may be a physical being struggling against other forces of life , with immune system a killing machine against bacteria and the entire organism consuming other animal and plant organisms it deems food , something that can not claim itself a moral being , but i am not as vile as nature itself .

a social , and especially a noble act , defy instinct , emotions , pleasures , and reflexes as well as norm and inclination , and concentrates on fulfillment rather than happiness.113 and a youth who witnesses that survival instincts govern every organism is all the more reliant on his family for any model of the good that might , to some degree , attest otherwise ; but most often in this institution the good is merely the defining of the bad , and the bad , more times than not , is violating the sensitivities of parents in the venal quest for procurement .
suicide as a whole organism or cancer , cellular failure to commit suicide and thus the replication of that which is not right and is detrimental to the whole organism , or the breakdown of a being in time are not so different from each other ; and any moral case that the latter is better than the former is fabricated for the stability of society and has nothing to do with reality .

clearly , every organism is able to create a model if not a detailed blueprint of itself , its challenges to the environment , and the environment itself , thus allowing for camouflaging to occur as if god himself had intervened .
but as each soulor at least some -- wants to be reunited celestially with parents and other loved ones , human or gecko , that happen to be rattling around in their brains , as their parents with their parents , and so on , which would include animal and microorganism progenitors as well , i suppose , it would seem that the heavens are an overpopulated hell hole much worse than the earth in which every organism , good or bad , is temporary ; hence , my only care is to be the soulless reality that i am and upon my cessation let me be equal to a dead rat that a street sweeper scoops up with other components of the days trash .
furthermore , clarity of lifes inception as a cell , replicating cells , or a multi - celled organism are still murky at best , which explains the ambivalence on the social position as to when a fetus is viable and can not be aborted ; and nature itself does not help with its myriad miscarriages , ectopic pregnancies , still born births , and the rate of child mortality which although not high in the modern era of vaccinations , once was high and is still high in regions like sub - saharan africa , and even now attests that no individual is destined to be on the planet .

... to destroy the invader and also any cells in the body which are presently infected by the outside organism .
lets just say that these are all infections by organisms that would normally not cause serious illness in a healthy body .
either their t4 cells did nt work properly to kick in the immune response , or the killer t cells could nt kill the organism , and they never got to the point of producing antibodies for the future .
what happens next is that killer t - cells are released by the immune system to storm in and destroy the invader and also any cells in the body which are presently infected by the outside organism .
in a smallpox vaccination , for example , a very small amount of the disease organism is introduced in the body intentionally .
basically , it has to do with deciphering the protein make - up of the invading organism and how to dismantle those proteins and therefore kill the unwanted cells .
yes , and the kind were talking about today is called naturally acquired active immunity , when we are exposed to a live pathogen one of those invading organisms i mentioned and create our own antibodies .
remember that we do nt produce antibodies until our immune system has figured out how to defeat and is in the process of destroying the invading organism .
remember that a primary function of antibodies is to record exactly what key is required to destroy a particular invading organism , and that wo nt occur until the destruction process is clearly working .
one is to create them when we are invaded by a previously unknown organism ; the other is to inherit antibody memory chips from our parents .
if we get sick , our immune system goes to work to fight the invasive organism ; and when its successful , it creates antibodies to protect us from getting that same illness again .
