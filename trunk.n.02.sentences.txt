haven begged him when she saw the open trunk , but he picked her up without much effort and threw her in with no regard .

the interior of the trunk glowed softly and had a putrid sweet smell , like decaying flowers .
` ` there 's a trunk with blankets and supplies in that corner .
the trunk held several quilts , a few canteens , a quiver of arrows , and a bottle of dark wine i did n't recognize and immediately left alone .
` ` this ... is impossible , '' she murmured once , brushing her fingers over a glittering trunk .
with a quick glance at the giant to make sure its back was turned , we bolted from our hiding place , crossed the open aisle and dived behind the trunk with keirran .
i ' m not so sure about this table , but i do have a really cool trunk in my room that i love .

the only other items in the room were eight trunks , just like the one containing the knives in the weapons basement .
minho glanced over at one of the trunks .
minho stood and stepped over to the trunk right behind them , knelt down , then lifted the lid and rested it against the wall .
the trunk was large enough that four stacks of maps could fit , and all four reached the top .
minho returned his gaze to the maps in the trunk , much to thomas 's relief .
minho pulled several sheets from the trunk , the maps from the last few days .
minho carefully returned the papers and closed the trunk , then stood .
minho got up and walked over to the section one trunk and opened it .
thomas put the papers in the trunk and closed it , hating the twinge of unease he felt .
` ` somebody burned the map trunks , '' newt said .
` ` i put each trunk 's worth in its own box , eight boxes total .
under the stairs you 'll find a steamer trunk .
i found the trunk beneath the stairs , shoved against the wall and covered in a fine patina of dust , as if it had not been moved or opened in years .
grasping it by its worn leather handles , i lifted the trunk a few inches from the floor : heavy , but not so heavy i could n't haul it up the stairs .
as i lifted the trunk for the trek upstairs , the voice of my enemy spoke ; fear whispered in my ear , echoing the words of warthrop : the fertilized egg is expelled into her mate 's mouth , where it rests in a pouch located along his lower jaw .
unnoticed went the cramping in my fingers , the burning in my shoulders from the trunk 's weight , the hard slap of the box against my knees as i climbed , the sunshine that flooded the higher steps bathing me in its luminescent shower of its beneficent light .
with a deep breath - how sweet the air did taste there above ! -i picked up the trunk and carried it down the hall to the library , in the doorway of which the doctor was impatiently waiting .
dedham , dedham , '' he murmured , falling to his knees before the old trunk .
the first object he pulled from the dusty trunk was a human head , mummified and shrunken to roughly the size of a navel orange , the skin turned the color of molasses .
he returned to unpacking the trunk .
a small wooden box containing a collection of ivory figurines , which the doctor turned over and over , the objects clicking together within his partially closed hand , as he rifled through the few remaining items at the bottom of the trunk .
he studied the map for a few seconds more , then whirled from the table , kicking over the old trunk as he flung himself away , as if he had perceived the gorgon 's eyes in the lines he had plotted , in the article unnoticed for three years , in the tormented calligraphy of a dead man from an autumn long since gone , and was forced to look away lest he be turned to stone .
there was the worktable littered with his research , the tipped - over trunk , its lid yawning like an open mouth , its contents strewn around it , the regurgitated effluvia of his father 's life , and the shrunken head resting on its side , its mouth frozen open in the apogee of a scream - but no pellinore warthrop .
` ` you thought perhaps i had taken refuge in my father 's trunk ? ''
` ` pack up the trunk , will henry , and put it away .
i righted the old trunk , emptied of everything but a dozen or so old letters still in their envelopes .
having traveled vast distances , these letters from a son to his father had been tossed unread into an old trunk and stored in a dank and dusty corner .
i dropped it into the trunk and scattered a few of its unsullied companions over it .
my face on fire from so close a call , i hurried to finish , tossing the curios and keepsakes back into the trunk , intolerant of my native squeamishness as i unhesitantly plucked the shrunken head from the floor .
it ricocheted against one side before dropping down , rolling onto its side , and coming to rest atop the other items in the trunk .
it was a key - to what i did not know , but it was too large to belong to the trunk or a door .
he had inventoried the trunk 's contents ; perhaps he knew all about the key pushed inside the hollowed - out head .
i shoved his father 's trunk beneath the stairs , and then stepped toward him , a bit out of breath .
of course , he had not ; i had deduced it from the letter i had purloined from the old trunk .
i thought of the bundle of notes to father from son , unopened missives of faded ink on yellowed parchment , at the bottom of an old , forgotten trunk .
just his trunk and some notes on various species of particular interest to him , notes that i suppose he could not bring himself to destroy .
he destroyed or discarded nearly all his personal effects , down to his last sock and shoelace , and would have the old trunk as well , i ' m sure , had he remembered tucking it away beneath the stairs .
the box and trunks you ca n't , but the driver may lend a hand if you provide the proper incentive .

i balanced carefully in one of the hammocks , my feet resting on the floor , acutely conscious of the red book tucked inside my coat as i watched tamar throw open the lid of her trunk and begin divesting herself of weapons : the brace of pistols that crossed her chest , two slender axes from her belt , a dagger from her boot , and another from the sheath secured around her thigh .

everyone halted and put the trunk down on the sidewalk .
one of the sailors took an iron key from his belt and opened the lock on the top of the trunk .
on the side of the trunk that now sat in the corner was a small triangular door that amos had not seen .

we thanked her and folded them into bronwyn 's trunk .

no one more than glanced at the big girl in the coat and simple dress , who was built like a stack of bricks and had lashed to her back a steamer trunk nearly as large as herself .
none who saw her could have guessed how stupendously heavy the trunk was , or what it held , or why a screen of tiny holes had been punched into one side .
bronwyn had set down her trunk and i was standing on it now , head above the crowd , casting my eyes over a shifting sea of faces .

i was , after all , on the second floor of the house , and while i did n't think there was any way i could lift the trunk high enough to get it through a window , the rail along the top of the staircase landing had long ago collapsed .
all i had to do was drag the trunk down the hall and push it over .
i hunkered down behind the trunk and began pushing it toward the hall .
it was n't a particularly dignified way of working - this squatting , butt - scooting motion i had to repeat over and over , each slide of the trunk accompanied by an ear - splitting metal - on - wood shriek - but before long i 'd gotten it out of the room and was dragging it , foot by foot , doorway by doorway , toward the landing .
i finally made it to the landing and , with one final indelicate grunt , pulled the trunk onto it after me .
then , holding my breath , i gave the trunk a little tap with my foot .
fifteen feet below , through a haze of dust and darkness , i saw what remained of the trunk .
in the midst of it all lay the demolished trunk , photographs scattered around it like confetti .
my grandfather 's pictures had come from the trunk that lay smashed before me .

finally they found a trunk with its lid flipped open , filled with a pile of old silk slips .
to be here , the only living soul in this quiet land , it made her wish for the stuffiness and dust of that trunk in the mannies ' attic , for the crows gathered round on all sides , the stolen picnic , the farting imp , and talon .
i parked , walked back to the ferrari , and when i got there , bennacio was going through the trunk .
i remember wearing old bathing trunks with a starfish on the butt , faded from a bright yellow to a kind of dingy white , and a wide white stripe of sunscreen on my nose .
we gathered around the open trunk .
she reached out and moved her hand along the object blocking her path ; she recognized the carvings along its surface as belonging to a large wooden trunk in which her mother kept woolen sweaters .
she saw a lot of big boxes , two trunks , a crib , four mattresses , and some old furniture .
the trunks looked the most interesting , however .
she put the coat on and knelt back down at the trunk .
she put everything back except the muskrat coat and turned her attention to the other trunk .
