these new circumstances brought with them , aloft in the muggy air , the pervading monition that an individual , immersed as he may be in the thrill of a new persona , must avoid becoming too consumed with this role , lest the role should , itself , succeed in consuming him ; mindful of such dangers , he paused briefly from his duties to catch his breath only to discover a procession of men trekking over a distant hilltop , carving into the elaborate stone pillars that lined it the edicts of a young and ambitious king whounbeknownst to the localshad long since laid claim to this land , declared as his subjects its peoples , and decreed , for the prosperity and tranquility of both , a series of severe religious and civil codes which , on transgression , bore devastating and horrific consequences ; adrift in his secret jealousies and mad yearnings , the sickened and hungry peasant fancied for himself a nature of kingly form , markedly different from that of the enviable totalitarian upon whom he spied : he constructed for himself from the substance of dream his own kingdom where he , too , could be the young and ambitious kingmuch younger , naturally , than he had been external to this whimsy and more ambitious than the implements at his disposal would allow him to be , for in the depths of his imagination , he could be afforded the luxury of forgetting his age and the fortitude to disentangle from the limitations imposed on him by this simple , passionless existence his unextinguished vigor , until he unleashed from within himself the capacity to reduce to dust and innocuous vibration all which had heretofore comprised his immediate circumstances , leaving in the lurch the diminishing residuum of that lurking phantom called time ; as this youthful , but unlikely sovereign , he ruled with utter malice and unquestionable self - interestas all autocrats shouldover a country made up not of men , nor of any other nature of hominian beast , but rather of blades of grass ; and as an embodiment of the grasses shared hopes and aspirations , his ascendancy to the throne was followed almost immediately by another inexplicable transformation , wherein he found himself assuming the shape of the grass itself , albeit , not in the form of a single , solitary blade , but as the whole of which all solitary blades must invariably become parts ; extended further in his fancy , he spread himself beyond the horizons to take on more topographical forms : those of pastures rolling into grass - stalked hills and smoothly - contoured valleys , oscillating upwards and then downwards , convexly then concavely , before descending finally to plainspunctuated by wild grasses , tangles of weeds , roots , and cohabitating mossesall of whom he forged together into a singular soul , a distinct and consolidated group consciousness which rippled passively in the traversing breeze ; if this was not enough , the idling and imaginative peasant was visited quite suddenly by the prospect of consociating with this amalgamated group awareness a realm with which he maintained a greater familiarity : the realm of man ; henceforth , he became the binding force of all social groups , the avatar of that shared pride and sense of belonging that formed the basis of all patriotism ; he became the collective search for meaning in the arts , the sciences , the humanities , and abidingly , in religion ; then he evolved once more : this time into an unquenchable sense of dread , a nagging lack of assurance brought on by those daunting remainders which purported themselves negligible in the face of their accompanying solutions , as though expecting one to ignore blatantly the ensuant implication that no answer could truly be whole ; he , thereupon , assumed the aspect of mathematical determinism , which compelled him rigidly and fastidiouslyas though overwrought by a newfound strain of numeric cynicismto seek to reduce all known quantities to nihility ; accordingly he came to languish in a fresh despair and he descended like a twirling , swaying feather back to the safer and more comfortable sphere of anti - intellectual curiosity , as he wiped sweat from his brow and proceeded once more to till the fields .

one could assume the hairs in these desert patches were shorn for some reason , conceivably out of faith to some religion , allegiance to some criminal syndicate , or loyalty to some arcane fashion trend of prior decades that had now fallen out of favor with the general public , but that still resonated with certain throwback pariahs ; however , it appeared that there was no stubble in these smooth , barren fields , conceivably no roots had formed ; and although one might be tempted to attribute this phenomenon to cessation at the follicle , this was most likely not the case as noted medical experts had asserted publicly time - and - time - again with unquestionable certainty that there had been no documented cases of any sort of condition in which the subject in question had been consciously able to prevent hair growth in certain regions while allowing fertile growth in others ; nay , this strange pattern of chest baldness may conceivably have arisen by way of some fungal invasion somewhere either in the dermis or in the subcutaneous layers of his skin .
