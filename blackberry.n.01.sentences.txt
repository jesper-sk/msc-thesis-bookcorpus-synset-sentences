there 's a big tangle of blackberry bushes there , mostly bare by that time of the year .
it was like her youth was comm back to her , and it was n't until then , sittin in the moonlight by the blackberry patch with her , that i realized how old she 'd come to look that fall .
the rain 'd stopped , but i could still hear the water drippin deep in the blackberry tangle behind the house , and see drops of water hangin off the bare branches .
once we stopped usin the old well , the half - acre behind the shed grew up in those chest - high snarls of scrub blackberry , and the thorns tore and pulled at my slicker as i walked back n forth , lookin for the board cap on the old well .
i got down on my knees , keepin one hand up in front of my face so the blackberry thorns would n't scratch my cheeks or maybe put out one of my eyes , and took a good close look .
they might not hear screams comm from the blackberry patch behind our house , but then again they might ... especially if the wind was high and blowin the right way .
from where i was standin , i could look out along the line of the woodshed and see the white rock and the edge of the blackberry tangle .
then i told him i put the money in a jar and hid the jar in the blackberry bushes .
i stopped n pointed up into the sky over the blackberry tangle .
he pushed me toward the edge of the blackberry patch , and when the first thorn pricked my calf , i remembered that this time i 'd forgot to put on my jeans .
i could hear the sound of the brambles breakin n snappin n whippin in the air , but could n't see hardly anything ; once we was in the blackberry tangle , it was darker'n a woodchuck 's asshole , and in the end that hankie i tied up was n't any help .
i 'd picked the slip up , but my fingers relaxed when i heard that scream and it fell out of my hand n caught on one of those blackberry bushes .
a little breeze ran through the blackberry bushes , makin em rattle .
i was n't in a panic , not quite , and i 'll tell you how i know that : i stopped long enough to pick up the reflector - box i 'd had in my hand when we started out toward the blackberry patch .
i got up the last board - i had to yank it outta the blackberry creepers to get it loose - and tossed it behind me .
i stumbled my way outta the blackberry creepers n ran back to the house .
or what if someone comes to the house tomorrow - one of his drinkin buddies , or someone wantin him to crew on their boat or fix an engine - and hears screams comm outta the blackberry patch ?
the closer i got to the blackberry tangle behind the shed , the heavier my feet got .
i stood there listenin for almost five minutes and there was n't a sound but the crickets and the wind rattlin through the blackberry bushes and an owl hooty - hoom someplace ... prob'ly the exact same one i 'd heard before .
i stood there with joe 's flashlight in my hand , the beam aimed at the hole in the wellcap , feelin greasy , sticky sweat creepin down all over my body , stingin in the cuts n digs the blackberry thorns had made , and i told myself to kneel down and look in the well .
i could hear the blackberry thorns tickin n snickin as my jeans went slidin past em and over em .

i remember lookin down at my legs to see if they were scratched and bleedin from the thorns in the blackberry tangle , but accourse there was n't nothing like that .
it made me remember that night in the blackberry tangles - how that same smell came to me on a little puff of breeze - n that made me think of the girl in the pink lipstick n the striped dress .
i skirted around the big white rock between the shed n the blackberry tangle , stoppin for a little bit to look into it n listen to the wind rattlin in all those thorny branches .

as i spend my tranquil nights , here , among the overgrown stones of the place where i was so happy as a child , our walls now broken and misshapen among the thorny blackberry vines and fragrant smothering forests of oak and chestnut trees , i am compelled to record what befell me , for it seems that i may have suffered a fate very unlike that of any other vampire .
our walls were thirty feet high , immensely thick , older than the castle and keeps , old indeed beyond anyone 's most romantic tales and constantly being thickened and repaired , and inside the compound there existed three little villages busy with good vineyards that yielded marvelous red wine ; prosperous beehives ; blackberries ; and wheat and the like ; with plenty of chickens and cows ; and enormous stables for our horses .

since he was the franchise manager of big boys beef and ribs , wayne was given a blackberry for purposes of being reached .
as she put the device back in her pocket , wayne 's blackberry made a beep .
in fact , if big boy 's beef and ribs had n't provided one , wayne would have never owned a blackberry .
sorry kids , it was generation x ( and the generation previous ) that invented the lols , brbs , btws and the notable : - ) wayne pulled out his blackberry which showed a message .
andwell i ' m looking at the july bill for your blackberry and can see that you sent and received 2,781 text messages . ''
that 's why we would n't supply our regular employees with a blackberry .
and might i interject that the blackberry was not intended for personal use , maybe a few calls here and there , or one or two texts to your girlfriend that you 're running late . ''
fronds of ivy hung down over the entrance to the tunnel and thick blackberry bushes grew up from the ground , the thorns a natural warning to trespassers to keep out .
a small bowl of blackberry syrup and a chipped white platter with the last flapjack sat between jacob and his brother .
a blackberry case hung on the waistband of his jeans , and a dark blue satchel bag swung from his shoulder .
lena took out a blackberry , one of the new ones with a touch screen .
two points of blue light glowed in the blackberry screen .
lena brought up her blackberry again .
the mario bros theme song exploded out the speakers ; the title screen for the arcade version of super mario sprang up on the blackberry .
lena held the blackberry out to me so i could watch her play .
lena turned off her blackberry and tucked it into her jeans .
i saw a blackberry clip at his belt .
i had a friend drop off a huge bucket of fresh blackberries last week .
the man with the tunic smiled at the scene affirming : ` ` alive for violence and blackberries for liberty , the strength !
` ` no young , i run away that study of which the resultante operates blackberries together coll'operante of it .
entered the blackberry it went out from there the blonde .
the tip of the index finger began to distend , swelling with melanin like a blackberry .
he felt his blackberry vibrate in his pants pocket and retrieved it .
shed screech into her blackberry what a complete idiot lacey was .
at the edge of a muddy , cracked parking lot , she saw a small hole in a thatch of blackberry bushes .
he went to the entrance in the blackberry bushes and started crawling through them .
as he drove up to the cart , he saw the hole at the bottom of the thicket of blackberry bushes for the first time .
sure enough , there was a tunnel under the blackberry bushes .
he bent to his knee and pulled the box from where it d fallen in a tangle of blackberry vines .
no food problem either : a kitchen garden , a chicken or two , snared rabbits , nettles for soup , dandelion salad , wild asparagus and mushrooms and chestnuts in season , you could make wine from blackberries .
just outside the infertile ring , was a stand of blackberry bushes .
they traipsed through the scrub oaks forests until they were covered with ticks and scratched to distraction by blackberry bushes .
i see her on that long road under the trees , creeping along , and when a carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines .
he took a blackberry between his thumb and forefinger and held it up to the intense sun .
malcolm got out his blackberry cell phone and asked her for her contact info .
her blackberry was old anyways , she 'd just have one of the droids flashed and set to her verizon service plan .
it was one of the older blackberry models .
that shivery feeling passed through her again , but this time it was much stronger - almost strong enough to be painful , like a shock - and with it , like some weird deja vu , came that recurring sense of adulthood 's strange contradictions : a world where you could order blackberry meatloaf or eggs fried in lemonjuice whenever you wanted to ... and where some people actually did .
what replaced it was a tangle of blackberry bushes , shadowless under the eclipse - darkened sky , and a clear smell of sea - salt .
i ' m sure- jessie awoke in the mild , milky light of dawn with the perplexing and ominous memory of the woman still filling her mind - the woman with her dark hair pulled back in that tight countrywoman 's bun , the woman who had been kneeling in the blackberry tangles with her slip puddled beside her , the woman who had been looking down through broken boards and smelling that awful bland smell .
she had run into the blackberry tangles to get away from some other man , some other daddy who wanted to do a lot more than shoot his squirt on the back of her panties .
for some reason the dust bunnies made her think of the woman in her vision again - the woman kneeling in the blackberry tangles with her slip in a white pile beside her .
trisha thought they were blackberry bushes - they looked like the ones from which she and her mom had picked hatfuls of fresh sweet berries in the sanford toy woods , but it was a month too early for blackberries .
trisha thought they were blackberry bushes - they looked like the ones from which she and her mom had picked hatfuls of fresh sweet berries in the sanford toy woods , but it was a month too early for blackberries .
