the ground was damp and muddy , alive with insects and moss and moisture .
it was a creepy place , looming over us like a stone giant , all covered with moss and slime .
the space between was filled with brake fern , now fast growing up , and the track itself was green with moss .
with its granite stones worn jagged and in some places stained green from moss , it seemed to be beaten - down , yet its sturdiness belied those appearances .
look and i turned to see , just beyond the trunks and hordes of moss , a glimmer of light coming through the darkness like a beacon .
the area was just as the voice described in the vision : tall oaks studded in moss with palms filling in the forest gaps .
and in a valley not far off she had reared a great norman abbey whose tower she could see from her window , placing around it in the churchyard grey stones with the names of her ancestors carved thereon , and with a moss somewhat like old england 's moss .
and in a valley not far off she had reared a great norman abbey whose tower she could see from her window , placing around it in the churchyard grey stones with the names of her ancestors carved thereon , and with a moss somewhat like old england 's moss .
the ground is covered in soft moss .
he examined a pool where moss , algae and stuff grew .
he was known for lying on the ground , picking apart moss in front of a macro lens , looking for nematodes and shit .
its like a bed of moss , jeff helmuth murmured , as he lay back on it .
wet ; and moss covered , it was far from easy or safe going .
she was dressed in rotting cerements , her face little more than a skull grown with fine green moss .
with her back cushioned against the moss covered trunk , she thought of how far she had yet to go , and what awaited her at lock core .
she breathed in , then exhaled , distracted by the smell of his hair : moss , dry leaves , and something animal .
but , at the base of the stone , ditch saw a human skeleton in the moss and the grass and all of his plans changed .
through the hole , amid the roots , lay a paved floor obscured by wet leaves and slippery moss , which linked to the main path a few yards away .
acres of brown earth , scruffy brush , and scrub oak with dried gray moss hanging from dead gray branches .
scrub oak with dried moss hanging from the thin gray branches and a background of brown earth and gray sky .
not that he planned it that waythe smallest of the domes gargantuan stones had been over herebut the north side of any structure tended to have moss or lichen or some thallophytic plant .
onlyif it truly was moss , and if he truly was on the north side of the pilethe shadiest sidewhy did the moss feel dead ?
she could see the line of misshapen trees on the far side of the lake , their trapezoidal trunks rising from what appeared to be a sheet of glaring black glass , their meager boughs sprouting knots of gray moss and ropes of pink vine , the former the spitting image of a mildewed wig , the latter a perfect imitation of fresh entrails .
i thought about trying to lose it in the shun , but it it d find its way out , reetsle said , still glaring at the mud and the moss and the gut - like tendrils .
not to cast aspersions , but the front door to this particular specimen had so much snot - green moss on the frame that it was about half its original width , and she could nt even see the windows , not for all the flesh - colored tendrils tangling off the roof .
from just behind the wall of trunks and horse - hair mosses , a massive whooshing sound filled the air of the colony .
they got to the porch by walking through piles of dead pine needles interspersed with patches of moss .
she could almost see the moss growing on the sides of the trees .
inside these secondary higher walls , the noon sun did not touch much of the cobbled courtyard , moss extended from every fissure , almost carpeting the stony ground .
occasionally he would slow and extend his hand , and a bit of moss or fungus would fall to the ground from where his fingers had brushed against the soggy corpse of a once mighty oak or maple tree , now a soft and damp pillar of rotting wood pulp .
even so here and there i spied piles of bones with moss growing on them .
i ' m going to need to take him with me , speaks the stranger indicating with one of the guns at the injured man on the moss .
he leaned back against a tree trunk , cushioned by the thick moss that grew around its base .
he squatted down , pulling the moss to the side like a curtain as he squinted into the night .
frederick hefted the backpack to his shoulder , thankful he d had enough sense to grab it before burrowing into the moss .
it held a cobblestone porch with moss and weeds thriving on it like chest hair .
the air was moist and thick with the odor of moss .
in the yellow light he could only see a clotted darkish ooze on his fingers that could have been motor oil , snail slime , even wet moss .
ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of spanish moss beset them , and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragments of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create .
the road was here but crude , and when on the level its boundaries were not so marked as when it passed through the cuttings ; and in a little while i found that i must have strayed from it , for i missed underfoot the hard surface , and my feet sank deeper in the grass and moss .
he gathered some moss into a pile and blew on it , lighting it on fire and drugging himself with the deaths of the tiny souls trapped inside .
he could already see the pitiful young lovers , gathering like moss under the shade of towering oaks , playing pussy - pussy , kissy - kissy games .
he felt tree branches and leaves and dirt and moss ( i ca n't see them ) and his knife .
but now it is still trees and moss and super - real sunlight and danny and i are racing with unnatural speed toward ` ` the pocket , '' a swimming hole at the bottom of the railroad trestle in which great big carp lie motionless .
' bushes and moss and other stuff , i do n't know just what , ' mccarthy said .
he pressed his mouth against the tree to keep from screaming , felt his lips tattoo a kiss into the springy moss all the way down to where it was moist and tasted of bark .
he bit into the moss , screamed against the tree , inhaled frag ? ments of moss without being aware of it , and screamed again .
he bit into the moss , screamed against the tree , inhaled frag ? ments of moss without being aware of it , and screamed again .
they made no initial effort to run or hide ; in fact half of them actually stepped forward on their naked toeless feet , squelching in the melted snow , the muck , and the scattered fuzz of reddish - gold moss .
for a moment the jonesy watching in the hospital room ( he has pulled up the visitor 's chair and is sitting by mr gray 's bed ) thinks that the jonesy in the snowmobile shed at hole in the wall has been infected after all , and that red moss is growing all over him .
he senses henry when he passes him ? henry hiding behind a tree , actually biting into the moss to keep from screaming - but successfully hides what he knows from the cloud which surrounds that last kernel of his awareness .
i ' m pretty sure secondary comes from touching something that 's growing it - tree , moss , deer , dog , another person .
not noticing the red splotches of byrus on the leaves of some of the bushes , the red speckles on the green moss he crammed into his mouth , gag ? ging it down because somewhere back there in his tame oh - gosh oh - dear lawyer 's life , he had read that you could eat moss if you were lost in the woods , that moss would n't hurt you .

what appeared to be moss was growing on his throat , cheeks , forehead , and forearms .
the foliage closed in one final time banyans and scrub pines choked with gray beards of spanish moss but jack bulled the mercedes through , and all at once the undergrowth drew back .
the veranda was deeply shadowed by mats of hanging spanish moss , but once our eyes had adjusted to the gloom , we could see a thick and rusty chain encircling the double doors .
gray - green spanish moss dangled down like a curtain , obscuring the top of the gap between the doors .
to the left , leaning against the wall , was a sledgehammer with a rusty business - end and patches of moss growing up the handle .
it seemed to take him forever to get the ladder placed to his satisfaction , but finally the feet were on the bottom , between the bones of nan melda 's outstretched arm ( i could still see the silver bracelets , although now overgrown with moss ) and one of adie 's legs .
the ladder tilted , and i fell off with the flashlight still clamped between my side and my stump , first shining up at the darkening sky , then illuminating lumps of coral coated with moss .
there was only a thin scum of moss on the side that had been facing the wall , and i could see the highlander in his kilt , one foot raised behind him as he did his fling .
much of the leather had been overgrown with a blackgray moss that looked like spiderwebs .
the first was a hat , also furry with patches of that blackgray moss ; it had grown all around the brim and also in the crease of the crown .
there was a hollow running beneath one section of the moss - caked old trunk , and trisha squirmed into it .
once someone had told her that moss grew on the north or south side of a tree , but she could n't remember which .
there was no time to get away , they would all sting her at once and she would die with them crawling on her skin , crawling into her eyes , crawling into her mouth , pump - ing her tongue full of poison on their way down her throat - trisha thought she was screaming , but when she thumped her head against the underside of the tree - trunk , showering bits of bark and moss down into her sweaty hair and waking herself up , she heard only a series of tiny , kit - tenish mewling sounds .
ten minutes or so later her sneaker disap - peared through ground that was n't solid at all but only a deceptive crust of moss over a soupy pocket of mud .
he found a piece of broken tile , its sharp edges furred with what felt like moss .
the tenebrous whirr of its wings filled the smokestack ; stinking air streamed past mike in a hurricane , flapping his clothes , making him cough and gag and retreat as dust and moss flew .
without any conscious thought , he ran forward with both hands full of tiling ( in this light he could see the pieces were splotched with blue - gray moss and lichen , like the surface of slate gravestones ) , until he was nearly at the mouth of the stack .
a moment later he lifted his face - a face that was gray - brown under the dirt , dust , and bits of moss that the bird 's wind - machine wings had blown at him - toward the clicking sound of its talons on the tile .
the balloon glowed , full of a ghostly white light ; it looked like a will - o - the - wisp glimpsed in a swamp , floating dreamily between trees overhung with gray ropes of moss .
come in and take a rake or a bag of peat moss or maybe even the power mower .
by the moss , i reckon this tunnel must be decades old , if not centuries .
he was in little dunthorpe 's churchyard , breathing damp night air , smelling moss and earth and mist ; he heard the clock in the tower of the presbyterian church strike two and dumped it into the story without missing a beat .
he ran straight across it and flung himself into the ditch on the far side , landing on a soft bed of dead leaves and wet moss , his arms wrapped around his head , the breath tearing in and out of his lungs like stabbing jackknives .
another burning chunk of metal , this one better than seven feet across at its widest and shaped like a diamond , fell out of the sky , landed in the ditch twenty feet to his left , and the dry leaves on top of the wet moss were instantly ablaze .
harold glared dully down at his hands , which were plucking up bits of moss and shredding them .
harold glanced uncomfortably at fran , then down at the litter of moss on his cuffs .
he relaxed little by little , his left hand tracing the shape of speedy 's bottle - he had plugged the top with a piece of springy moss from a small stream where he had stopped to drink .
he supposed it was entirely possible that some of the moss would fall into the bottle , or already had .
he saw huge stones as black as sin , their rough surfaces splotched with green moss .
reaching for him - black - metal robot - faces , rusty greaves , mail splotched and smeared with moss and mould .
the cool rose gently off the water , and there was a green smell like moss .
' name 's freeman moss . '
even after moss and his museum piece of a truck had disappeared , gardener stood where he was for a moment longer , his wet totebag in one hand , his bare feet , white as easter lilies , planted in the dirt of the soft shoulder , looking at the marker some two hundred feet back the way he had come .
moss simply laid up behind a fallen tree with his rifle and waited until his father splashed across a small stream about fifty yards down the hill from where moss was .
far in the past , when moss was ten and his brother emory seven , abel 's wife went south to rhode island for one whole winter .
it had all made so little impression on moss that he could not remember biting his arm until it bled to keep from crying out , and he certainly could not remember emory 's breathless bird - cries from the next bed -'please , daddy , no , daddy , please not me tonight , please , daddy . '
' and the moss .
' t was you who told me about how to read north by the moss on the trees when we was kids . '
all the same , he had thought the whole thing was just a little buggyboo in moss 's head c moss was a good poker player , and he resented anyone whose money he could n't take .
' freeman , moss .
the ship could maybe pull the pin on all that ... but was that what freeman moss and kyle archinbourg and old bozie and all the rest of them wanted ?
it also weighed tons , but the mostly silent freeman moss had transported it from bobbi 's dooryard all by himself ... it had taken him most of thursday and about five hundred batteries to do it , but he had done it , something which would have taken an ordinary construction crew a week or more to accomplish .
gard , watching this with the bemusement of a veteran drunk ( and surely no one sees as many strange things as one of those ) , thought that moss looked like a scrofulous animal trainer leading mechanical elephants through the woods to the site of some unimaginable circus .
such things were outside his practical knowledge , but he guessed that a single gadget such as the one moss had used on thursday with such absent ease could cut the cost of a project the size of the aswan dam by twenty - five per cent or more .
' here , ' moss said , handing gard a heavy packsack .
holding the controller in one hand and the customized metal - detector in the other , moss walked toward the motor .
' i ai n't him , ' moss said .
he handed six batteries over and watched moss fit them into the compartment .
floating the motor sucked less juice when it was going downhill , but by the time moss had finally settled the big motor - block on the edge of the trench , they had gone through forty - two batteries .
back and forth , back and forth ; one by one they brought the pieces of pumping machinery from freeman moss 's truck to the edge of the trench .
on the fourth trip , gard had asked moss if he could try it .
' that , ' gardener said weakly , ' was wzon , where it 's only rock and roll because that 's the way you like lt . you mind if i sit down for a minute , moss ?
it took them the rest of the day to get all the equipment out to the trench , and moss was so tired when the last piece arrived that gardener had to practically carry the man back to his truck .
gardener respected moss more than the other three ' helpers ' put together ... in fact , he liked him .
these ' dumper hoses , ' as moss called them , were big , wide - bore rolls of canvas that gardener supposed had been scavenged from the vfd .
' ayuh , got a few there , got a few other places , ' moss said , and would offer no more on that subject .
the man had only grunted in his inimitable freeman moss style .
' sounded like a pine , ' moss said .
it was gardener 's turn to look at moss and say nothing .
' might have been a spruce , ' moss said , and although the man 's face remained perfectly straight , gardener believed moss might just have made a joke .
this morning , no freeman moss .
freeman moss .
gard was instantly reminded of freeman moss , moving the pumping equipment like an elephant trainer moving the big guys around the center ring .
9 freeman moss arrived first .
the parasol 's fire - hem bellied outward , and moss 's shoulders and face were enveloped in sheeting flame as he backed away .
the paint on the hood of moss 's truck and on the sides of the pickup first bubbled , then blackened , then burst into flame , burning down to clean white steel .
the litter of bark , sawdust , and woodchips in the back of moss 's truck blazed up like dry kindling in a woodstove .
12 even overmastering moss 's dying screams , anne anderson 's mental cry : eat shit and die !
as he made his way back inside the shed , the twin gas tanks of moss 's truck went up with a furious roar .
he also remembered the nosebleed and the blast of sound he 'd taken as a result of his single experiment with moss 's levitation gadget .
15 dick allison and newt berringer were still two miles from bobbi 's place when freeman moss 's mental shrieks began .
they were not great takers of orders as a rule , these tommyknockers , but moss 's hideous screams , fading now , were great persuaders .
16 now , with the screams of freeman moss just beginning to fade from their minds , the screams of andy and ida bozeman took their place .
almost all of these gadgets could be mentally activated with the help of simple electronic devices which were casually dubbed ' callers , ' not much different from the device freeman moss had used to float the drainage machinery into the woods .
dick saw the burned hulks of bobbi 's truck , moss 's truck , the bozemans ' olds -and then he saw the whirligig .
judging by the awed reactions of his ' helpers ' ( even hard - headed freeman moss had n't been completely immune ) , he did n't think they would ... but it would n't do to forget how desperate they were .
and he had looked at the base of that high gray wall and had seen a heaped drift of old bones and grinning skulls , some of them furred with green moss .
the trees grow beards of spanish moss that hang nearly to the ground and float their ancient white tails in the breeze .
when it hears the car behind it , it turns its head and she can see the face - human but disfigured , part of the skull exposed , one eye crazy wide and the other sleepy lidded , a pallor the color of moss or rot .
ole mister moon 's beaming me just enough light to find the mound of moss and rocks where the sneak - in point is .
foster felt himself drifting into a cathedral of cypress trees and spanish moss where time revolved slowly without any interference from mankind .
their appreciation for the delicacy of the insects and the intricacies of the spanish moss brushing through their hair was clearly enhanced by the quality of their weed .
a gentle breeze stirred the spanish moss in the trees .
foster , can you explain to me what is meant by the expression , a rolling stone gathers no moss ?
