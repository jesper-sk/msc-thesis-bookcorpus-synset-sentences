this relationship blight followed him into his adulthood , marring any prospect of having any kind of healthy bond with a member of the opposite sex .
below , the rundown , long abandoned school sat , a blight upon the blighted land .
there were , in such voyages , incalculable local dangers ; as well as that shocking final peril which gibbers unmentionably outside the ordered universe , where no dreams reach ; that last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all infinity - the boundless daemon sultan azathoth , whose name no lips dare speak aloud , and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable , unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffled , maddening beating of vile drums and the thin , monotonous whine of accursed flutes ; to which detestable pounding and piping dance slowly , awkwardly , and absurdly the gigantic ultimate gods , the blind , voiceless , tenebrous , mindless other gods whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
for madness and the void 's wild vengeance are nyarlathotep 's only gifts to the presumptuous ; and frantick though the rider strove to turn her disgusting steed , that leering , tittering shantak coursed on impetuous and relentless , flapping its great slippery wings in malignant joy and headed for those unhallowed pits whither no dreams reach ; that last amorphous blight of nether - most confusion where bubbles and blasphemes at infinity 's centre the mindless daemon - sultan azathoth , whose name no lips dare speak aloud .
