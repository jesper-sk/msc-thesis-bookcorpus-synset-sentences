their twisted branches had a sculptural beauty against the steel blue sky .
the branches of trees made a thick net overhead ; where they extended above the edge of the pentagram , their leaves curled and turned black .
there was the gnarled copse of trees , their branches intertwining , the valley walls rising all around , and there was the small house .
he froze , then stepped hastily into the shadow of a tree and peered up through its branches .
the branches overhead made lacelike patterns against the starlit sky .
he was simultaneously aware of every leaf on the branches above him , every tiny pebble on the ground , every pair of eyes that rested on him .
knotted tree branches overhead blocked some of the moonlight , but it was still fairly bright .
there was nothing around him but the grass , the river running by , and the trees above , spreading their thick branches overhead like a green net .
the lowest tree branch was about twenty feet high ; he caught at it , swinging himself up and over .

most of the branches were bare .
it was an unseasonably warm day , and a faint wind rustled the last of the leaves in the tree branches .
chilly wind rattled the few dead leaves that still clung to the branches of the trees .
deadly sharp rocks sliced through the ice and snow , along with the bare branches of hedges and frozen moss .

she used the tip of it to pry the tough , thorny branch free .

he carried a bow made from a curved branch , and his hair was long and bark - colored .
a faerie warrior was looming above her , decked in silver armor ; his hair was not hair at all , but a ropy tangle of thorned branches .
there they were again , throwing snowballs in prospect park ; and at luke 's farmhouse , tanned from summer , hanging upside down from tree branches .
it had a stark grandeur in the late winter , so close to christmas : the mountains rose in the distance , capped white with snow , and the trees along the side of the road that led back to alicante from the lake were stripped bare , their leafless branches making lacelike patterns against the bright sky .
bright sunlight filtered through the branches , and warm may air rushed me as i flew over the uneven ground .
branches shook , sending a waterfall of green needles whirling into the air .
i turned , lifting her over a fallen branch .
no birds were chirping or fluttering from leafy branch to branch .
no birds were chirping or fluttering from leafy branch to branch .
the needled branches all blurred together .
the trees closer to the yard were singed , and a few of the bare branches were burning , billowing black smoke into the air .
the great massive oaks and pines around us shook , branches rattled , and birds - thousands of them - took flight , their wings beating into the air as they circled high above the colony of homes , veering sharply to head in the direction of where we 'd come from .
the impact shook the branches above , and a shower of leaves floated down as the origin slid across the ground , kicking up loose soil and rocks .
the stars peeked out from behind the thick branches .
frowning , i squinted at the tree branch directly above the observation deck .
the branch seemed thicker , shinier .
curled around the branch was an abnormally long and thick snake .

a branch cracked .
i averted my eyes to the left , focusing on a branch as the giant cat inspected me , unable to bring myself to look him in the eye for fear of screaming .
` ` even the dog is against me , '' i mumbled , picking tiny leaves off a fern branch and tossing them aside .
every so often his back would brush against a snow - covered branch , sending clumps of the white stuff cascading down and releasing the fresh , crisp scent of evergreen into the air .
hundreds of thousands of twinkling lights , coiled like snakes around naked tree branches .
off to the left stood the largest evergreen tree i 'd ever seen indoors , its fresh woodsy scent filling the room , the branches covered in beautiful antique - looking ornaments .
i watched the two of them hang bulbs off the branches while i sipped the creamy concoction , relishing how much it reminded me of christmas with my mother .

it towered over me , its branches spreading out at least thirty feet .
i gazed in awe at the perfectly round , stiff leaves of kaleidoscopic colors hanging from the branches .
i could ' ve spent hours mesmerized by the peculiarities around me - the two - headed owl settled on a crystal branch , the patch of rainbow - colored four - leaf clovers , two squirrels prancing along the ground on their hind feet , holding hands as a loving couple would - but the four figures now standing beyond the bowl were more than enough to occupy my attention .
a loud crack sounded , a branch snapping under pressure .
glass smashed , followed by a loud creak of metal and branches snapping outside .
i took the bait , running after him , never able to catch up but thrilled to see his strong , lean frame move swiftly through the thicket , dodging trees and branches , practically gliding over the deep snow banks .
judging by the broken branches and crimson stains on the ground around us , i ' m pretty sure we did n't land on our feet like cats .
` ` too bad you 're not allowed to climb the trees , '' i murmur with a head shake as i watch reese wrap her arms around a tree branch and start pulling herself up .
she keeps moving forward like a little ninja , silently leaping over bushes and avoiding branches that will crack .
there 's a rustling of branches as ben climbs over the hedge , tossing off his shirt .
ben 's arms fall from me as he steps forward to stand in front of a tree , reaching for some ripe fruit on a high branch that i ca n't reach .
she asks , joining in to test and pull some fruit off the lower branches .
she asks coyly , standing beneath a branch that extends out above her head .
peeling my eyes away from her piercing , i give my head a shake and shift over to gently pull the branch down .
just in case she decides to throw herself at me - because i ' ve had that happen before - i let the branch snap back up in the air as i take several steps backward .
i press up against the window to see the top of a tall , narrow tree on the corner , its needled branches like pipe cleaners .
i stretch an arm to point out the small branch coming off the lake .
on its height , and its bare branches .
he walked past me without a word , slung the rope over his shoulder , and began climbing the tree , all the way up to the first branch .
holding it up for us , her finger touches the low branch on the right - hand side .
at last he turned and sought even higher ground , climbing steadily up the slope even when it seemed impossibly steep , often reaching for a grip upon branches and firm rock to help himself .
he pushed at the heavy overgrowth , letting the small branches scratch at his hands and face .
and he let himself keel over and land upon the forest floor , so that he could see straight up through the lacy branches of the pines , the stars spread out gloriously above the fleece of the clouds , and the moon sailing gently northward .
in seconds they were sliding away beneath the lowering tree branches , and mona and ryan made a little picture , standing together in the gate , both waving , mona 's hair like a starburst , and ryan clearly baffled as ever and highly uncertain .
their branches were filled with bright resurrection ferns , once again green from the recent spring rain .
the sun struck her eyelids , as if some big branch or cloud had just freed it , and the light made the darkness brilliant orange , and she felt the warmth creeping all over her .
and when he finally stood under the tree 's great spreading branches , he looked up at the facade of the tower , and saw a lone figure in the third window .
` ` but this somebody else is part of my heritage , this somebody else has her own branch on this tree , and up through the tree from its roots runs this potent fluid , our lifeblood , and he was part of it , he lived in it , you might say , yes , ancient , and long - lived and forever , sort of like trees .
the branches of the trees came down to stroke her face , to touch the water .
it shone on the weathered shack behind her and on the few feet of dilapidated pier , and on the tendrils of moss that hung down from the dead - looking branches right above her .
the smell was the greenest smell she had ever smelled , oh , but when she looked up , the sky was that glowing pink that it can be in the louisiana night , and the disappearing trees stuck their futile little branches out to connect with each other , and the moss became translucent , veils and veils of moss .
the very topmost branches were thin and covered over with webs , silvery webs , were they spiders or silkworms ?
down through the swamp trees with her hands up , trying to catch the branches .
how far the winds of the earth can carry seeds , birds , twigs , branches , uprooted trees , i have no idea , but that which loved heat thrived in this land , and this is where we began .
the branches of the pine or whatever tree did not lose their leaves .
the branches were making a racket on the top of the car .
she drew closer , and in the few feeble rays of light that broke through the branches , the long , very golden light of the last of the day , i saw her beautiful white teeth , and how her br**sts looked beneath her fine lace blouse , and above her painfully tight leather girdle .
and the dark car sped out of the multishaded gloom , leaving behind the somber corner and its regal house , the great leafy branches holding darkness like ripe fruit beneath the violet sky , the car a projectile destined for the green heart of the world , carrying them inside it , the two , male and female , together .
but a crude woman with her sleeves rolled up had another slave standing in a hogshead of soapy water , the slave 's hands tethered to an overhanging tree branch .
almost before she knew what was happening , beauty had been forced to stand in such a tub , the soapy water swirling about her knees , and as her hands were tied to the branch of the fig tree above , she heard mistress lock - ley call for prince roger .
and ahead at the end of the row of tents , she saw a whole gathering of dusty and naked slaves , their heads down , their hands tethered to the tree branch above behind a man who called out to one and all : ` ` hire by the hour or the day these lovelies for the lowliest service . ''
the branches of the trees spread out above making a green shade from the sun , and i saw the beautiful burgundy velvet of the mistress 's dress beside me .
they were male slaves , at least twenty of them , their natural skin color unchanged , each mounted on a smooth wooden cross that was planted in the earth amid the flowers and the grass , under the low tree branches .
he chose what looked like a long , slender twig , picked clean of smaller branches , and made of a whitish - silver material .
the green branches of trees moved on the other side of the street , an emerald canopy , but it was noiseless .
the glint of the river was visible through them , and the branches above knotted together into a canopy , blocking the brightness of the sun .
` ` tess , '' he said , his voice thick and soft with desire , and she leaned toward him , swaying like a tree whose branches were weighted by snow .
the voice that came from the doorway behind tessa was soft enough that it could almost have been part of the wind that rattled the leaves on the tree branches .
five girls sat beside , and upon the branches of , the oldest apple tree in the orchard , its huge trunk making a fine seat and support ; and whenever the may breeze blew , the pink blossoms tumbled down like snow , coming to rest in their hair and on their skirts .
brambles snagged at his clothes as he ran and a branch knocked his hat from his head .
some dry leaves fell , and then something white tumbled from the branches to the earth with a dry , whispering sound .
he clambered up the hill , swiping at the leaves with his free hand , swatting at the twigs and branches with his bag .
and i ' m tattered and torn , '' said tristran , fingering the huge holes in his trousers , and in his coat , where the branches and the thorns had seized at him , and the leaves had cut at him as he ran .
he thought they were glow - worms or fireflies , but , on closer inspection , he perceived they were tiny people , flickering and flitting from branch to branch .
he thought they were glow - worms or fireflies , but , on closer inspection , he perceived they were tiny people , flickering and flitting from branch to branch .
he peeled the bark from a green branch and wound it around the upper fork of the y .
the star leaned forward , her fingers tangled into the unicorn 's mane ; tristran - his hunger forgotten in his fear - gripped the sides of the unicorn with his knees and simply prayed that he would not be knocked to the ground by a stray branch .
glow - worms and fireflies glittered green and yellow in the hedgerows and in the branches of trees .
as she removed her dress , revealing a healthy expanse of petticoat , tristran felt the branch begin to give way beneath his feet , and then he was tumbling down through the air in the moonlight ...
he stopped looking for a woman in the branches of the copper beech tree above him and looked instead at the tree itself .
a huge branch , itself as big as some trees , had fallen from an oak tree onto the path directly in front of the horses , and the driver , who was also the coach 's sole occupant , was endeavoring to lift it out of the way .
tristran and the driver unhitched the horses and roped them to the oak branch .
then the two men pushed , and the four horses pulled , and together they dragged the branch to the side of the track .
tristran said a silent thank you to the oak tree whose branch had fallen , to the copper beech and to pan of the forests , and then he asked the driver if he would give him a ride through the forest .
but perhaps there will be more fallen branches to move .
unasked , tristran walked over and began to help her , carrying the heavy boxes from her cart to the stall , climbing a tall stepladder to hang an assortment of streamers from a tree branch , unpacking heavy glass carafes and jugs ( each one stoppered with a huge , blackened cork and sealed with silvery wax and filled with a slowly swirling colored smoke ) , and placing them on the shelves .
a branch of lightning struck in the distance across a cloudless night .
he could n't spy her out through the thick growth and the waterfall 's mist , but he could n't remain much longer - a branch cracked behind him .
leaves and branches slapped the windshield as the cab bounced .
gritting her teeth , staring at the branches above , she let her knees fall open .
they were all coated with ice , their branches ponderous with it .
brandr ducked under a branch .
it had stopped snowing , and i looked up at the red - bottomed clouds through the cold , black branches of the maple tree i had planted for my dad upon his death .
wide - eyed , i looked to the east to see the first flash of red - gold through the black branches .
as soon as the moon hits that branch , it will attack vi .
jenks exclaimed , the heartache of a child 's death gone as the moonlight seeping through the branches brushed the statue , seeming to make it glow .
no , tree branches and bones . ''
her voice was wispy , like wind in branches .
immediately he realized his mistake when daryl leapt into the branches , following him .
she screamed , her sword thunking into the branches as he dodged her .
the living vampire had driven them out here on her cycle - bis on the gas tank and grinning into the air like a dog - but now she looked bored , lying back on the bench with her knees bent to gaze up into the branches of the tree .
i am so weary of ultimate resolutions ... ` ` i ' ve got an idea , '' he said as he jogged through a stand of young trees , ducking some of the larger branches as he moved through them .
the bent branch sprang forward , jenks rising up so it moved harmlessly under him , sighing with its passage .
angry , trent pushed at a branch , almost snapping it .
jenks persisted , his wings clattering as he made the short flight to a leafless lower branch and sat in a drop of sun that made it through the canopy .
a branch he had his foot propped against gave way , and he slid , effortlessly catching himself on a rock .
head up , he reached for an overhanging branch and went hand over hand , feet swinging above the rushing cold water .
jenks stood on a bare branch , his hands on his hips and a smile quirking his expression .
it was a tremendous beech , still standing straight and gray , its thicker branches yet holding up the sky .
you ca n't imagine what it 's like to suddenly find out ... '' will looked beseechingly up at the dead branches , searching for words .
with a last look , he hung it forlornly on a dead branch and turned to follow them out .
the soil here was broken rock , not giving enough purchase for anything but grass and brambles apart from the very center where a pine tree eked out a living , its branches dead or dying as it stretched out its limbs as if desperately trying to touch its neighbors for help .
` ` the tree no longer holds me , em , '' he said , reaching up to pull himself into the broken , needleless branches .
black wings were flying through the branches and circling the tree .
her white wings shimmered into existence , stretching to the high branches .
` ` you need me , just whistle , '' he said as he arranged his ball cap over his eyes against the sun leaking through the frost - emptied branches .
nina sniffed , shifting her shoulders to look at the sky through the branches .
jenks shrilled as the last of the branches fell back to earth , and trent looked up from where he had hastily covered quen .
the sun did n't seem any dimmer , the sky was just as blue , but looking at the shattered stumps and splintered branches and wilting leaves , i knew my soul was a little bit darker .
frowning , i stood to look at the orchid jammed into the crook of two branches .
` ` i saw the pools of shallow water , the moss green branches overhead , '' i said , voice ragged .
` ` it 's not like i have anything on my plate , '' i said , staring up at the dark branches as my steps slowed .
he asked , holding a dogwood branch heavy with last night 's rain out of the way .
i had to force myself to move forward to duck under the branch , and i did n't know why .
water spotted my shoulder when trent let the branch go .
her nose was wrinkled , and i could hear pixies in the branches .
` ` we do n't work for cormel , '' one shouted back , and i heard a crack as someone broke a tree branch for a makeshift club .
the trees were sparsely scattered , their branches naked , their bark weighed down by dripping ice .
` ` found them snagged on a branch . ''
though we 'd played hide - and - seek a thousand times before , i always hid behind our towering oak , which boasted swaying branches and chirping birds .
yet , as i listened to the wind howl outside the window , and heard the branches scratch against the glass , my eyelids began to feel heavy .
he carried me into a hidden cove shadowed by towering na**d branches .
we walked slowly , keeping pace beside each other , zigzagging through the thick trees and branches .
their branches were bare .
when she did , those flames spread and those thorns grew branches , each destroying her bit by bit .
he maneuvered around trees , their trunks and branches blurring into a haze of brown and green .
she and zacharel rolled down , down , hitting branch after branch , not really losing momentum before they ... boom !
she and zacharel rolled down , down , hitting branch after branch , not really losing momentum before they ... boom !
the tip of a branch must have slicked straight through to his gums .
she had more injuries than she could count , and the wings ... those hideous wings that had grown into misshapen branches with bulbous membranes rather than feathers completely unbalanced her .
the branches bowed all the way to the right side , forming a canopy .
the trees breathed with life and vitality , branches waving gently .
he leaned against the nearest tree , one with red leaves that made the branches look like they were bleeding , and began carving x 's in his arm .
the moment she was dressed , she scaled to the highest bough , fluttering wings giving her speed and agility , and reclined on a fat branch , peering up into a lovely star - sprinkled sky .

the moon was high and full , but with the canopy of leaves above them , its golden light skimmed the branches , never quite reaching them .
the branch shook , but just over their heads , an arrow embedded in the trunk .
he and sabin shared an oh - shit glance and burst into rapid - fire movement , shoving past ice - laden branches and being slapped in the face for their efforts .
leaves and branches slapped at her , and insects buzzed , some daring to bite her .
tree branches reached out , slapping at him .
a mutant dog - monkey hybrid materialized on one of the branches , swinging toward him and throwing an apple at his head .
lazarus paused to move a branch out of her way .
he released the branch and laughed when the thorns slapped her .
he could still see jecis 's trailer , but it was now surrounded by barren hills littered with dead trees , fat insects flying from one gnarled branch to another .
but she had not fallen from the ugly tree and gotten hit by every branch , thank you .
thankfully no one else appeared , and when nicolai and company were no longer in sight , leaves and branches shielding them , she erupted .
chapter fourteen nicolai dragged jane through the forest , branches slapping at him .
beneath her fingers , she felt the branches shift , swaying toward her touch .
` ` i guess it was just a tree branch cracking in the wind , '' he said .
she laid her head on his shoulder , and she swore she could hear the creak of swaying branches beneath his shirt .
the opening was crisscrossed with vines and branches , turning the sunlight green and dank .
sunny gazed up at the expansive live oaks , their branches gnarled like an old woman 's hands , spanish moss dripping downward like heavy lace .
the flag hangs from a tree branch , high above my head .
she gives me a patronizing look , the way people sometimes look at children when they act too adult , and snatches the flag from the branch .
my feet sink into the ground , and above me , the branches grow into one another , forming a kind of tunnel .
its branches are spread over most of the greenhouse , and its roots bubble up from the ground , forming a dense web of bark .

i giggle , but of course it 's just tobias , ducking under a branch .
that evening , i am too embarrassed by what happened to go to dinner , so i spend the time in the branches of an apple tree at the far end of the orchard , picking ripe apples .
i am wiping my forehead with the hem of my shirt , standing on a branch , when i hear the sound .
i grab the branch above me with both hands , but pull myself up with only my left arm .
i use the nearby branches as steps , with my hands to steady me , twisting and leaning around the tree 's maze .
the branches get thinner , weaker .
i need to climb as high as possible , but the branch i ' m aiming for is short and looks pliable .
i start to lift myself up , to put the other foot down , and the branch snaps .
i do n't allow myself to think ; i just put one foot down , then the other , so fast that bark peels off the branches and drifts toward the ground .
the branches dip low , and i pass just beneath them .
their branches grow into one another , creating a maze of leaves and twigs and apples .
when he bends over to untie his shoes , i see the symbol of amity on the small of his back , the branches curling over his spine .
i walk outside as the sun peeks through the tree branches , and see a small group of amity gathered near the orchard .

i rise , and her fingers , brittle as branches , close around my arm .
their panes glow in the starlight , obscuring the treasures i imagine to be inside them , small plants with berries dangling from their branches , rows of potato plants buried in the earth .
up ahead , there is a concrete bridge built across the walls , and framing the tracks are buildings , wood and brick and glass , their windows dark , trees growing around them , so wild their branches have grown together .
i walk past a potted plant with a garish flower blossoming among its branches , and toward the dormitory that has become our temporary home here .
i imagine myself trimming back all the stray branches of my thoughts , focusing on just this place , just this time .
the minutes i had left with him fall away like dead leaves pulled from branches .
this formal living room had been decorated elaborately with pine branches and holly leaves on the fireplace mantel , and prettily wrapped presents stacked alongside the brick hearth .
nestled in the branches of the fake tree were dozens and dozens of coconuts .
she 'd first said it when i showed her my favorite tree , with a branch wide enough for sitting and reading , completely hidden in the canopy of leaves .

votan wrapped his still weak hands around a thick branch , careful not to touch the ants scrambling down one side ( bugs disturbed him , too many legs ) and then pulled himself up .
like a giant , featherless bird , he perched on a branch , looking for any signs of the priests ' encampment - usually a large smoke plume - however , there was nothing beyond the massive span of hazy blue sky and the ocean of treetops .
suddenly , the branch gave way .
the tree branches swiped the sides of the open windows as we passed , flicking small pieces of bark and leaves at my face .
i followed as quickly as i could , but the branches and vines whipped my face and caught on my feet .
i looked for something to throw - a fallen branch or magic floating rock - but there were just my sneakers .

a tree branch snapped off to my left , making me jump and i practically ran up to meet him .
he suddenly saw me , as he perched up on the branch .
i started to stand up and rush over to the tree when he dropped from the branch .
the breeze was cool as it rustled through the trees , the last of the yel ow leaves still clinging to the branches as winter approached .
cold weather had left the branches void of leaves , and they scraped across the pitched roof of the house .
the tree branches hung low and were heavy - laden , the snow layering everything but the frigid , fluid lake .
when i push away the bush 's scratchy branches and duck through the gap , a part of me still hopes , irrationally , that i 'll find it .

the tire swing pitched and rocked from where it hung beneath the massive tree that took up most of our small backyard , the tree 's branches pummeled by a sudden gust of harsh wind that followed in troy 's wake .
children 's laughter filtered through the branches and leaves , obscured and distorted .
soft grass cushioned the ground floor , and lush - leaved branches created a canopy overhead .
moonlight leaked between the twisted branches and struck as a radiant glow over william 's face when i stepped out into our spot .
the trunks grew high and the branches sprouted out about halfway up , reaching out to shade the entire yard .
rushing over the trail , i pushed branches out of the way as i hurried to our spot faster than i ever had .
william pounded through the forest , branches lashing his face .
the moon peered down , casting shadows across the floor , branches brushing along the walls .
loose rocks crunched under my feet as i inched up the road veiled in branches and bushes , gun braced by two hands and pointed out in front of me .
roots worked to hold me back , branches slapping my face as i flung myself into its depths , frantic as i searched .
yellow and red leaves fell from branches and flitted to the ground , the october air cool and crisp .
i found my footing on the lowest one and gripped a branch as i hoisted myself up .
i yelped when the third step gave , but i managed to hold myself up on a solid branch , pulling myself up the rest of the way .
i drew my knees to my chest and rested my head back against one of the large branches that grew up from where the trunk had segmented into four .
she wrapped her hand around a branch and pulled .
` ` do n't you dare drop me , jared holt , '' aly shouted near his ear as he raced across the lot , ducking down to miss a tree branch as they passed .
furies of harsh wind pummeled the thin branches of paloverde trees , slanting them askew .
dropping his hand , i wedged my boot onto the first rung of wood that had been hammered into the trunk and began pulling myself up to our fort housed in the branches above .
those large branches grew tall , stretching toward the sky .
he scooted up beside me and rested his back on a thick branch that helped to support our fort , this place made of fairy tales and hopes and dreams .
we stared up through the barren branches of the tree .
the sun had broken through the clouds , and rays of light glinted down through the branches as we passed by .
tree branches beat at the walls , a squall of heavy wind lashing at the earth .
yellow leaves rained to the ground , falling from the old tree as the weight of each sway drew a low creak from its branches , reminding me i was growing up and that , soon , this swing would be a thing of my past .
hanging from the old oak tree in the backyard , a fat grey body swung from side to side , flailing around in an attempt to free its paw from a branch .
david curled his palm around a branch and hoisted himself onto it .
` ` the boy , who reminded him of his own son , attacked the vampire with the jagged edge of a broken branch .
david turned away from me , extending his arm to grasp a tree branch .
he dropped his hand from the branch , his brow staying up in an arch of mockery .
across the road , wiry branches guarded iron gates , warding visitors away from the dwelling of the dead or , perhaps , imprisoning them .
each tree had turned a different colour with the near - autumn air , and as the leaves fell from the branches one by one , they gathered in piles or floated down the curve of the road , leaving a wash of yellows and reds and oranges all over maple terrace .
my heart was so confused by the combination of terrors that , if i was afraid of being this high up - of looking out across the city and the steep valley of trees beyond the gardens , feeling as though i could land on the ground miles from this spot if i fell - i did n't notice it , even though my only beams of safety right now were the splintery shelf of branch , only as wide as my hips , and the secure grip of the predator 's fingers around my arm .
like a flash going off in my face , my mind blanked for a second , waking to a branch against my spine , my fingers clutching it tightly to stop from falling to depths of the empty space behind me .
i held onto the branch with both hands , letting tears trickle down my temples and over my ears as i watched my zorro walk away - stumbling through his own , deep agony .
he pried my hand away from the branch and held it up , leaning closer .
the scar david left on my other hand tingled , and as the cold touch of jason 's lips mopped my flesh , i shut my eyes tight , digging my nails into the branch , waiting for the sear of his razor teeth .
my legs gently fell on either side of the branch , my feet dangling into oblivion .
before i could think to react , the sear of venom barred my tears and the weight of his body against mine forced the branch into my spine , as if it would rip me in half .
i let go of the branch and dug my thumb into his wrist , merely making him hold tighter - trapping my anguish inside of me .
i reached out , panicked , grabbing at imaginary branches as my head followed my feet , sliding downward .
a girl said , swinging one leg over the branch of the tree above him .
the girl sat back ; one leg tucked under her knee , her dress hanging loosely past the branch , twirling a strand of her long brown hair .
the girl smiled and sat with both legs over the same side of the branch , the boy right beside her knees .
he hooked a hand over the branch and swung himself outward a little .
maybe marshland , creaky branches and a grey sky . ''
arthur stood beside me , looking at my face , then the tree sitting centre field , its branches reaching out like welcoming arms .
as we stepped through the thin branches of wilting willows and into the garden , the sweet essence of summer filled the air .
we strolled in silence for a while , leaving the summer behind on the border , where the shorter trees , with full leafy branches , stood as fairy - tale sentries .
i had n't thought of that , but now that you mention it , i ' m sure i 'll be looking over my shoulder and jumping at every snapping branch i pass . ''
mike looked up as a crow landed on a branch behind us , cawing loudly in the silence .
rubbing the pulse in my wrist with my thumb , i started walking , cautious eyes checking every branch before passing under it .
* * * despite this forest being so uninhabited that the branches had never been trimmed and a trail had never been cleared , it felt kind of like the trees made an aisle for me , turning their heads as i passed , wondering what my business here was .
behind me , the bird sat on a wiry branch , his weight making it bend a little , his call still sounding in my ears .
then , he cawed again and flew off , his silky wings beating the foggy air , until he ducked past a branch and was gone .
the branches around my feet had shrivelled away from thick and bold to skinny and scrawny , the shrubs and grasses making way for cages of dead twigs .
i ran after him , pushing wiry branches aside as they struck my cheeks , my brow , my forearms , and as i flew into the clearing where the little boy went , stopped dead .
i looked up to the weaving branches , blending in with the black of night as the last clouds ate the sun .
darkness fell , descending like a velvet cloak , ingesting the treetops , the branches and , finally , the trunks , until all i could see was my own hands if i held them right up to my nose .
if i sat there all night , i might not get hit by branches or feel the itch of hairs raising on the back of my neck from things i could n't see , but one thing was guaranteed ; if i did n't get up , get walking and find my way , all hope would be lost , and i would not only fail my people , but never make it home again .
i 'd walk and stumble and feel pointy branches scrape and pinch my skin , not focusing too much on time , until i walked so long i had to stop and catch my breath , realising only then that day had n't come any closer .
i held my hand out to the emptiness , half expecting to feel snow , when i heard something - a scuffle , a purposeful brush of a form against a tree branch .
all around me crickets sounded the song of dawn , and the trees , with their tall , reaching branches , stretched out to the heavens , warming their leaves in the golden glow of the sun , while a fresh , moist breeze brought a dewy , sugared taste to each breath i took .
i felt hollowed out , numb , walking backward until i found the welcome embrace of wiry branches , holding me up .
each entangled finger of branches seemed to deliberately slow me down - touching me , grabbing me , snagging on my dress and arms .
i squealed , grasping at every branch to stop myself falling , coming to rest with a thunderous impact on my knees , my hands , then my head ... . a rushing sound , like an express train in a subway , forced my eyes open .
as midday drank the cool in the air and infected it with a gooey heat , i laid , watching memories like films in my head , while the bare branches above me joined hands again across the grey - white sky , applauding the movies as they ended .
and you pulling against that , trying to grow up - go out on your own branch , it 's got him panicked . ''
` ` legend has it that her father went down to the orchard to scream at the gods , and when he looked up at the oak tree , this was sitting on the branch his daughter had fallen from . ''
i walked cautiously between the columns of trees , pinching the leaves on a few branches as i went to see if they were real .
` ` auress , '' she said , and my gaze went up the trunk to the tiny child sitting on the longest branch - one leg dangling down , her finger twirling a lock of hair into a curl .
she smiled and reached up to pluck something from between two branches , holding it out in her open palm after .
when we came to the border where i left my clothes , the butterfly perched itself on a tree branch .
he took a few steps away and started digging under leaves and branches .
` ` it 's bright , easy to see , and i figure you can hang it off a branch or something . ''
` ` i ' m going outside to clean up some branches .
though i ' m taller now than when i last climbed it , it seems impossible to get to the lowest branch .
when i have my breath and courage back , i continue up , branch after branch , until i ' m standing with one hand reaching into the old hollow , groping around .

finally , after bouncing bravely over rocks and cracks and stray tree branches , it gives up .

with that , she pushes back a final branch and strides away .

he begins to stack a fresh batch around the flames , poking angrily at the fire with a long gnarled branch .
ethan gasps for air , clinging to a tree branch to keep himself upright .
bad enough to capsize like that , but i took out a protected habitat in the process , crashing through the web of sticks and branches like it was a barrier at the edge of a racetrack .
last time , the trees loomed dark and ominous above me , but now they 're green and lush , with sunshine falling through the branches and dappling the ground .
sunlight falls through the tree branches , dappling us with light , and i try to make the scene look as picturesque as possible - despite the mud streaking his face and the fresh bruises on his legs .
i brush past branches , ducking and swerving away from oncoming trees , and all the while , my heart is racing faster than these wheels .
the water is rushing past me in a soothing flow , the sun warms my bare shoulders , and the tranquil calm of the breeze rustles at the overhanging branches .
ethan applauds me , poking at the fish with a gnarled branch .
i shrug , snatching a leaf from a branch as i pass .
not just the thunder , which still rings out occasionally , but the sound of the rain itself , beating down on every rock and tree branch in a loud drumming that makes it hard to hear a thing .
crossing the room , i look out , checking that a branch has n't gotten trapped in the shutters again , or - ` ` hey , jenna ! ''
it 's cooler now , and my thin summer dress and sandals are no match for the scrape of tree branches and tangle of tree roots underfoot .
all the bugs and dirt and branches .
it was simple , sure - a sturdy floor lodged over the v of two wide branches , planks hammered into uneven walls , a dripping roof - but it was hers .

alice managed to obey him for all of five seconds before leaping up herself , following him across the branch floor .

above us in the trees i could see a squirrel cautiously approaching the end of a branch , about to leap to the next .
the branches were high up and what little wood did litter the ground was covered in moss or rotting leaves .
behind him i could see the breeze stirring the uppermost petals of the cherry blossom tree , snatching them from the branches to the ground , to be trampled beneath the feet of the students aware that the bell had rung .
through the window , i could see the maple tree in the garden , the nearest branch just a foot or two from my window - when i was a child , reluctantly returning home from school for the weekend , i would often seek solace in the crux of its branches , where the trunk would divide into four and form a neat little seat , perfect to fold into .

he and earl had made a makeshift ghillie suit out of a few branches and the wet , dead leaves that littered the forest floor .
the weights were perched on the thin branches , with the pins of the grenades attached to the trees , situated so that when you brushed one of the trees hard enough to make the upper limbs shake , the weight would drop , taking the grenade with it while the pin would stay in the tree .
what had probably been a three - foot - deep babbling brook in the narrow ravine was now a rushing river full of debris , including broken tree branches as big around as his bicep .
when he started wading in , broken branches and other debris almost immediately smacking into him , zane flinched harder than ty did and curled one hand into a fist .
zane glanced downriver , seeing how the water crashed against the rocky sides of the ravine indiscriminately , smashing up branches and anything else in its path .
as he crawled slowly toward it , he found a thick tree branch that was still fairly green and hefted it .
ty slid to the ground and grabbed at the end of one of the sticks in the fire , turning with the flaming branch in his hand and breathing hard as he waited .
for whatever reason , he felt better with the branch than he had with the shotgun .
` ` in the far corner over there , '' ty answered immediately , pointing toward the edge of the lot where several large trees with spindly bare branches loomed over the cars parked on the crunchy dormant grass .
ty rose slowly , looking with absolute horror at the flames that licked at the tree branches above .
it would be well shaded in the summer , but for now the bare branches reached up to the heavily clouded sky .
zane 's hand tightened in ty 's and ty had to laugh as he dodged a low - lying oak branch and tramped along in the moonlight and flickering light of the lanterns that lined the alamo .
a low branch hung out over the grass , and beneath it , a blanket had been laid out .
the first pop of pre - emptive fourth of july fireworks over the alamo made them both jump , and zane turned so they could watch the fire rain down from the sky through the branches of their oak tree .

above them , the trees stretched their bare , skeletal branches out in all directions , creating a dark wooden canopy that screened out what little sun there was .
flashes of the crushing avalanche that had almost buried us both , then one of the branch that had pierced the creature 's leg and of me shoving the sharp wood out so the wolf could walk again , even a memory of me facing down preston and the wolf spoiling the reaper 's aim when preston had tried to kill me with a crossbow .
i had n't noticed the giant bird , but it must have been sitting in one of the trees during the whole creepy ritual , because it launched itself off a branch and down toward nott 's back , its talons outstretched and ready to tear into her .

the chanting increased , more rhythmic than ever , matching the increasing beating of the branches together .
jacques dubrinsky jumped out of the uppermost branches of the trees and landed easily on his feet .
so many varieties of trees , branches reaching upward for the dark , midnight blue sky .
he landed hard , snarling , raging and grasping at the branches to keep from falling .
she did n't even see him , just the furious shaking of the branches as he rushed back up the tree to the very top of the canopy and flung himself at her a second time .
he shifted into the form of a smaller hawk , streaking through the branches of the high canopy in the forest , making certain to stay close to the edge of the meadow , certain bardolf had been ordered to stay close to the tunnel to keep any carpathian from interfering .
he lengthened the branches , and this time changed the leaves and needles to spikes .
the smaller hawk was able to maneuver through the dense foliage , but the larger eagle crashed into the lengthening branches , the spikes driving into the body and wings of the bird .
the second was two steps away , cursing as he got hung up on a thorny branch .
tree branches swayed and danced to the wind .
near the island , over by where the reeds were the thickest , was a strange underwater lodge built of tree branches and downed tree trunks - a beaver lodge - yet he doubted there were beavers in the lake .
the wind gently moved through the branches , setting them swaying .
she could n't move , she was just too exhausted , but staring up at the canopy overhead as the branches swayed and danced to the music of the wind , she realized how lucky she was .
the trees towered above her , branches swaying and dancing in the wind .
yet here he was , hanging from the branch of a tree , pierced with silver , wrapped in silver chains , helpless to even aid his lifemate should she run into trouble .

even as the thought entered his head , the wolves took to the trees , leaping high to catch branches , working their way around the twirling silver walls .
his spirit moved downward along the trunk of the tree of life , passed the upper branches .
yet above him and just to his left , there was a pocket of warmth between two branches , almost as if something had been caught there , or had clung there .
knowing he was hidden from view and his mixed blood hid his energy from the lycans , he shifted , going to pure vapor , racing up through the branches until he was behind the lycan .
he 'd tied a bit of cloth to an outside branch across the clearing to get a feel for the wind .
her spirit seemed caught in the branches and he had to pause to figure out how to get her free .
it was only then that he realized skyler had somehow attached herself to the branches .
he remained where he was , his light surrounding skyler 's warmth , between the upper branches .
she could n't have lost her way in the other world as some souls had done , because she had been anchored to the top branches of the tree .
he wanted to believe , even in her dying moment , skyler had thought to secure herself to those upper branches in the certain knowledge that he would come for her .
he could detect the wolves in the swaying branches of trees as well as the brush along the edges of the forest .
another nodded , peering through the branches to watch the chaos below .
in one motion , dimitri 's sharp sword sliced through branch and neck so that the head tumbled to the ground below .
he whirled like a dancer , never actually placing his feet on the branches , but rather performed the brutal ballet there in the air , keeping the close quarters so that the lycans were hampered by the branches and leaves .

one lycan managed to extract himself from the branches .
` ` we have n't done anything to you , '' one pleaded , moving his head to the left to peer around the branch , trying to get a look at dimitri .
the hand holding the gun stiffened and then went limp , the body sliding toward the ground , only to be caught in the lower branches where it lay sprawled out in a macabre manner .
the lycan leapt from the tree , clearing the branches , his arms flung out from his body as if he had wings .
she could hear the creak of tree branches around the meadow as the wind played in the leaves .
she dropped down into the canopy of the forest , flying lower through the branches , playing a little , as she had to maneuver through the openings between boughs .
he heard the sap running deep in the trunks and branches .
he caught glimpses of the glow as well as a scattering of stars through the canopy and branches .
it was dense with branches and needles that appeared silver whenever the moon shone through .

the bird made for the tree several meters across from the ferns , flew toward a high branch and veered off sharply .

zev moved to the next tree via the long , sweeping branches touching the tree he was in .
skyler , take cover , he warned abruptly , fear skittering down his spine , everything in him straining to protect her , but even his incredible speed , leaping from branch to branch was not going to get him there in time .

another wolf , a huge male , leapt from a distance away , as if he 'd come from a tree branch rather than on the ground .
he reached out and casually cut through the belt looping around damon 's hip , dropping the cache of weapons to the branch .
i ' m coming back with a camera to take a picture of the trees with all those scorched branches , though .
branislava made out his face by the light of the moon shining through the branches overhead .
catch the next branch , branka .
she did as he said , reaching with her light to wrap firmly around the branch .
zev held tighter to branislava as she fought to stay on the branch .
zev drew branislava up the tree to the thicker branches closer to the top , moving fast , whipping around to the other side of the trunk .
the blast shook the tree , but hit branches a good distance from them .
the branches exploded , splintering , and then coming back together .
they sped through the branches , dodging the worst of the flailing limbs , and quickly entered their own bodies .
trees closed around them , branches reaching up to the night sky .
arno and arnau lay within the flowers and branches of the funeral pyre , high up where their spirits would have an easy ascension .
the color spread to the branches and then to the leaves .
flames licked at the wood and flowers , burning the first layer of the pyre and igniting the logs and branches holding the bodies of arno and arnau .
he sent them to their slaughter , death by fire , a putrefying blend of incense he had mixed with poisonous tree branches hidden among the flowers and branches after the pyre had been built .

the sickening grayish white of the trunk and branches dulled .
branches and leaves took on a normal tone and the fog receded from the tree , driven back away from it by the glowing fireflies .
a healthy mottled bark replaced the sickly white color from the ground up the tree to the reaching branches , and finally the leaves turned silvery green .
the music continued to play , drifting on the wind , the branches of the trees swaying gently , as if keeping time .
she was right , but he felt like a man stuck in quicksand who desperately reached for a faraway branch even though he knew his movements were going to hasten his death .
neil lifted his foot over the branch and waited .
` ` just a branch .
she dumped a few larger logs into her pile and moved away to gather more branches .
neil gathered the smaller pieces of wood , discarding the branches he knew would cause an excessive amount of smoke , and piled them to start the fire .

i finally broke contact when i sensed the changes in the tree slowing ; i looked up in wonder at the being that had grown in the space of about two minutes from a sapling into what was now a mighty oak with far - reaching branches that shaded the space where my mother 's earthly body would rest until it turned into dust .
it was dominated by the branches and leaves of the ancient one - the biggest tree i 'd ever seen in my life ... the tree i 'd communed with once , and then forever after had sensed the presence and power of in my link with the green .
i felt angry tears rise up in my eyes and i swiped at them in frustration as i trudged through the woods , heedless of the fallen branches that usually tripped me up .
ben and i backed up , as chase slowly lifted himself up into the air , easily and gracefully skirting past the branches of my mother 's tree so that he could take flight .
chapter 12 a grouchy maggie showed up not long after , joining the three of us under the branches of the ancient tree where chase remained tied .
` ` now go to that one over on the left ... the one with the low branch hanging down .
i learned some of the basics about not breaking off branches or disturbing the underbrush when i was walking , and how to recognize signs that the green elves were in the area .
i followed along , looking down most of the time , trying not to trip on the fallen branches and tangled vines on the forest floor .
the mighty tree rose up out of the forest floor , its branches spreading out over our heads to reach deep into the forest .
a branch overhead moved and caused a groaning to echo out through the forest .
its branches shuddered and stiffened .
leaves began to rain down on our heads and a gigantic lower branch of the tree moved slowly towards me .
the giant branch reached my feet and i knew exactly what to do .
as soon as i stopped moving , the branch began its upward climb , extending until it reached the next branch up .

i pulled energy up from the ley line and shared it with this tree , and watched in delight as small , baby leaves on its nearby branches unfurled to welcome the fading sunlight .
i looked above me to the treetops but there was only grayness between the branches .
an hour later , after climbing over fallen branches , kicking about a hundred mushrooms - a favorite pastime of mine - and tripping through the mist that had begun to gather around my ankles , we made it to a super giant , twisted up tree .
i asked the tree to lean towards me and provide some branches for the way down , and it responded the best it could ; it was n't the biggest tree in the world - nowhere near the size of those in the green forest - but it was good enough to give me a few less feet to jump down .
i stepped out onto the branches and lowered myself to a spot five feet above the ground .
there were fallen trees and low - hanging branches everywhere .
a breeze moved through the trees , pushing some branches aside .
tony looked around the branch that was in our way .
he did n't see some branches in front of him and they hit him in the face .
it 's just some branches that have been shoved aside .
we were still walking over fallen branches , rocks , and other things - not what you would expect to see on a path that was well - traveled .
but the way the branches were well away from the area , it seemed as though it could have been used quite a bit .
she was short , so it was hard for her to climb over the bigger branches - unlike me , graceful gazelle that i was .
the branches parted and out stepped spike , his slingshot dangling from one fist .
` ` yeah , but did you notice how high up those branches are ?
i slowly reached up to the branch sitting next to my shoulder and gingerly plucked two leaves off .
as soon as i pulled my hand away , the branch sprang back up , making a mighty groaning sound , the branch and leaves creating a whooshing sound as they rocketed from my shoulder level back toward the sky .

there was a crack in the limb that had moved for me - and there was no doubt in my mind that this branch had moved for me .
i saw sap coming out of the crack in the branch near the place where it connected to the tree .
she gestured to the pile of leaves and the crack in the branch above us .
do n't get me wrong ; the tree did n't hug me back , not with its branches anyway .
i actually could n't see it very well , since it was so obscured by its own branches and those of the nearby trees .
piles of leaves and other branches had collected around it , making a small mountain of debris to hide behind .
we walked for another hour , picking our way carefully across logs and branches and through brambles and other sharp pokey things .
they had lots of branches .
i picked the one that had the most branches .
he grabbed the lowest branch and started to come up behind me .
i reached a spot that did n't have any handy branches i could use to help me get to the next level .
` ` there are n't any branches nearby . ''
the one i was on did n't have any branches that could help me - but the tree next to mine had some really big ones up here .
` ` tree , move a branch for me so i can see higher . ''
some branches nearby moved a bit , but it could have been from a breeze , it was so slight .
my mind 's eye saw one of the big nearby branches swinging over to where i was standing , positioning itself to hoist me up to the highest level of the tree i was latched onto .
the branch that had been fifteen feet away from me had moved .
the tree it belonged to was groaning , but the branch remained still , extended out directly in front of me .
i tentatively put my foot out , left one first , onto the big branch of the larger tree .
i swallowed the panic that began to rise up and quickly closed my eyes , imagining a second branch being there for my hands to hold onto .
the tree strained , lifting its two branches as high as they would go .
as the branch started to move to its original position , i reached out and touched it again briefly with my hand .
when i got to the last branch , i dropped to the ground and stood , anxiously looking around the base of the tree , trying to locate tony .
three trees standing witness to our battle had interlocked their branches , creating a net of sorts .
i played pictures through my mind as i grabbed hold of the nearest branches .
as tony approached , the tree that had branches above his head bent down , wood popping and snapping with the effort .
while tony was wrapped up in battling leaves and branches , i slipped around the side and faced off with the hag .
they could communicate feelings to me and respond to my requests doing plant stuff with their branches and leaves - but as far as i knew that was the extent of their capabilities .
help me and my friends get up in your branches .
the branches of a huge nearby tree leaned down .
` ` grab onto the branch ! ''
once we had grabbed hold , the tree lifted us to the next branch up .
another branch lowered to meet us and we all grabbed on desperately .
another branch came down and we all climbed aboard .
she used the leverage to get a better grasp on the branch .
now that we were higher up , but still not so high that the view below was obscured by other branches and leaves , we could see what we were dealing with .
they were snarling and jumping up on the side of the tree , trying to grasp the lowest branch .
i had moved to the inside part of the branch so i was against the tree 's trunk .
one particularly persistent wolf was jumping up , over and over , trying to reach the lower branch .
no sooner had i said that than the wolf succeeded in grabbing that friggin ' branch , to the absolute jubilation of his pack mates who started snarling and howling all at once .
the wolf on the branch fixed us with a hungry look , saliva dripping out of the corners of his mouth as he flexed his biceps , slowly lifting himself up and hooking his arms over the branch .
the wolf on the branch fixed us with a hungry look , saliva dripping out of the corners of his mouth as he flexed his biceps , slowly lifting himself up and hooking his arms over the branch .
i could tell that the wolf thought he had it in the bag , a savage smile curling up the edges of his mouth - when all of a sudden the tree next to ours swung one of its branches over and whacked the ever - loving shit out of that wolf , right on its stupid wolf head .
he roared his displeasure and doubled his efforts to re - establish his hold on the branch and continue his upward movement .
now two large branches from neighboring trees swung over , their wood protesting with groans and cracks that rang out through the forest .
then our tree started shaking its branch up and down , making it impossible for the carnivorous beast to hold on , especially when combined with the beat - down from the other trees .
i mean , i 'd have to pull my pants down and dangle my hoo - ha over the branch , giving the wolves a perfect view of the golden palace of the himalayas .
the tree began to offer branches for us to climb down so we could join our friends .
seconds later , we reached the lowest branch and spike , chase and finn showed up under our tree .
chapter twenty - three i jumped down from the last branch and ran to spike , jumping into his arms , wrapping my legs around him too .
i could picture the green tying tony up and hanging him upside down from a tree branch .
and the day had started out so well ... chase walked to the base of a tree , looking up its trunk to the branches above .
the branches started moving in response to my requests .
the only sounds i heard were the swishing of the branches and the creaks and groans of the wood as the tree strained to do my bidding .
the branches waved back and forth as the green energy coursed through their fibers .
we watched as new leaves came out of new buds on the branches .
after a few moments , the dark liquid abruptly stopped oozing from the tree as the green energy moved from the branches down the trunk and sealed the great crack , leaving the tree whole and unbroken now , beautiful healthy branches and leaves reaching up toward the sky .

these vine handcuffs were then attached to another vine dangling from a tree branch above me .
a large branch had been jammed down his throat and out his back end .

i was trimming back branches on gishi fruit trees in eaststar 's groves .
edward watched as i cut through a branch and tossed it into a neat pile .
i looked for other branches that might need pruning .
kifirin was suddenly there before me , standing in the space between rows of gishi trees , their deep green , oval leaves sighing in the late afternoon breeze and fruit hanging heavy on their branches .
sighing , i made the turn , my head just beneath a heavy , overhanging branch .
the carvings were intricate and whimsical at the same time - leaves , plants and tiny creatures that hid among the vines and branches .
teeg grumbled more than once when he was slapped in the face with a tree branch as i lumbered along .

it was unattainable except he had let go off their clench on the branch were they were now lashed and secured .

busiku took his foot away from the one limb of an epic tree where it had been established so that he seized his position and secured himself in one piece to that other one oversize and bulky branch that he was right this moment on .

the merciless light of the street lamp poured down like the full moon through the branches of the trees - on the cracked flags and the marble steps banked with dead leaves , and on the high thick fluted columns with their peeling white paint and black patches of rot , on the crumbling boards of the porch which ran back unevenly to the open door and the dull pale light from within wobbling ever so faintly .
the morning sun was already high in the sky , and the birds were singing almost furiously in the leafy canopy of branches overhead .

the tree was bending close , and then swaying back ever so gracefully , and this time the branches veritably blotted out the sun , and the leaves tumbled down the glass , broken and spinning .
she lifted it as high as she could reach and slipped the curved hook over the thick part of the shivering branch .

he tried to stand up straight , to find some direction in which to run , but everywhere he looked he saw the nine - paned windows , the keyhole doors , the oak branches piercing the ceiling and the walls and the whole house like a great monstrous trap re - forming around the struggling gnarled trees , flames reflected in the high narrow mirrors , couches and chairs overgrown with ivy and blossoming camellias .
my branches lofty are taking root .

i say , however , that it will be more than this ; i say : the day comes , glowing like a furnace ; all the arrogant and the evil - doers shall be chaff , and that day when it comes shall set them ablaze ; it shall leave them neither root nor branch .
i want you to inquire of yourself if you would , upon seeing such earthly beauty , bring into existence your great and terrible day in which all the arrogant and evil - doers shall be chaff , set ablaze , leaving them neither root nor branch .

` ` why , i do n't know , '' moncey said , surprised , when they had tracked him down , lazing in a meadow on the mountainside with some of the other winchesters and small ferals : they were playing a bit of a game , where they tossed tree - branches upon the ground and tried to pick up as many as they could without dropping any .
so he informed himself , in cool reasoning terms , and nodded back , the whole exchange wholly divorced from his body 's involuntary response , where every outline became a dragon , and every grumble of rustling leaves a prelude to attack , and they had yet to keep moving on steadily , through pitch impenetrable enough that laurence put out his hand before his face , to keep from running into any branches .
tharkay motioned laurence to wait with woolvey , and after a moment came back to silently guide them to a place he had found by the hedge : a low rock butting up near the wall , and a thick elm - branch above : he had already rigged a cord hanging down .
the horse and the general wheeled away , aides in train , and laurence went back to temeraire , who was pushing the last few logs into place with a broken - off branch , to save his talons from singeing : the fire was still very hot .
it was most convenient : the soldiers could simply be swept away by the dozens , and the branches sheltered one from the musket - fire ; so there was no risk at all .
the massacred trees , which the dragons used for their sweeping , were in a great heap at the edge of camp and the dark bare branches darker still with dried blood , a forest 's graveyard .
temeraire only just stifled an undignified yelp as the tree - top fetched him a sharp slap across the neck and belly : the branches were springy , and stung painfully .

he ignored me for a couple minutes , peering in a vaguely benign way at the skeletal branches of the tall trees that stand all around the park 's central grassy area : at them , or perhaps at all the buildings around the square revealed by the season 's dearth of leaves .
impossible to tell what kind of tree , as it has no leaves , no label to say who sent it , nothing but a small wicker cage tied to a branch with a fairly large brown bird in it .

when she pulled it open , she found herself squinting in the noon sunlight that filtered through the avocado tree branches .

a shadow abruptly loomed on the other side of the wall furthest from his bed , and the wall slid open along a track to furnish laurence a glimpse of a corridor and another room across standing half - open , indistinguishable from his own , save for a window which looked out on a slim cherry - tree with bare dark branches .

junichiro was already doing his best to obscure the marks their landing had made in the bank with more dead leaves and branches .
a host of fiddler crabs , too small to be worth the attention of fishermen , scuttled away rapidly along the empty seashore at laurence 's approach : numerous enough that he and junichiro were able to rake together a pile of them , with branches , onto a rock and away from their escape into the mud .
junichiro thought as much , when they had made some more calculations , and refreshed by their crab supper they plunged back into the forest and hunted out a few sturdy fallen branches , to be latticed together with saplings and the interstices stuffed with leaves .
the wind was in the west , gentle , a mere breath ; he finished the last of the work , two branches crossed and tied with some strips of fabric cut , with a sharp rock , from the robe he wore ; the rest of it he rigged on her as a sail , and striding out into the water he pushed the foot of the makeshift mast through the raft while junichiro steadied her , and secured it beneath with another knotted length of fabric , filled with sand and pebbles .
mast and sail both tipped ; branches cracked ; abruptly laurence was in the water .
they slogged through the remaining distance slowly , with the longest branches as walking - sticks .

dozens of gnarled roots rose and fell throughout the clearing like minor hills ; hundreds of thick branches , some so big around they looked like smaller trees themselves , flowed out and up from the trunk ; thousands upon thousands of leaves that must have been larger than my entire body whispered in the midsummer breeze .
lights flickered from between the branches and in the trunk itself , lights that glowed blue and silver like captured stars .
we were inside the branches of the bower tree .
aiilyn either did nt hear or did nt care she kept walking , and the boy in front of me did as well , the muscles that lined the brief expanse of his shoulders outlined in the light of the too - large moon that filtered down through the long flat leaves of the branches above us .
after another series of turns , we emerged from the side of a branch so high up in the limbs of the bower that i had to stop myself from retreating back inside .
i looked up , trying to keep my mind on moving forward , on following aiilyn along the path that wound through the branches here , a path with no rails , and saw the moon riding high to my left .
she crossed to me in the field , picking up speed with every step ; her hands were extended and grasping , reaching for me like the twisted branches of wind - blown trees ; her eyes blazed with fire that held me immobile even as i knew i should run .
aiilyn kept us scrubbing floors until we were used to it then she had us carrying bales of roots up from the deep caverns into the refectory , a chore that left my back a mass of tortured muscle then she had us in the field , pulling rocks from the ground and tossing them into the forest then she had us in the highest branches of the bower picking berries from huge thorny brambles that grew all throughout the leaves of the tree , giving us several dozen prickle wounds each to add to our growing inventory of ailments .
i coughed and hacked and spat up a warm glob of bloody phlegm that slapped against a tree branch and glimmered darkly in the light of the setting moon and winking stars .
i fell forward , bracing myself with my hands as i did , trying to brace the shadows that hung draped from the bows and branches of the wooden sentinels that lined the clearing .
pick up that branch now .
faolan released him as tristan bent to the ground and picked up the branch , then faolan bent to the ground himself and picked up a handful of rocks and started throwing them casually into the tree line .
familiar waves of pain and nausea rolled over me as i raced after the running form of the boy , toward whatever it was that was waiting there on the other side i broke the barrier of the clearing and crashed through tree branches to find a narrow path beaten through the brush , barely visible even with the glowing silver light streaming from my hand .
i stumbled over a root , pitched forward in the darkness and rolled over my shoulder , twisted and wrenched myself back to my feet , breaking through another clump of branches , racing over a small mound i stopped .
my whole world narrowed in on that dodging trees , jumping cracked and bending branches , stepping between strewn sheets of fallen leaves .
my next step snapped a branch , so loud to my ears it was like a boulder rolling down hill or a spike of lightning spearing the sky with an echoing cry of thunder .
i rushed noiselessly over leaves that should have crackled , then broke a branch that fell to the ground loudly .
i glanced up at the tree as i rounded it , looking through the tall branches toward the top that was always hidden what seemed like miles away , thinking that oberon was up there even now , thinking that tonight was the night i would confront him .
there was more noise from outside more roars , more snapping branches and then the urden burst from the trees , retreating before an oncoming wave of creatures that shone like the sun .

when she was seven , she had been hiding in the woods one day in early june , hearing the snapped branches and the jeering voices of the children who followed .
she was sure of it when she saw her mother lie back in the tall grass beside the harp , just under the beginning branches of the forest .
myrrha did not know how long they walked , but she roused when her mother tripped on a branch in the path and fell .
myrrha could have reached out like a branch and scratched him , trailing her nails like twigs across his skin , hooting like an owl at the same time , and he would not have known she was there .
they were both silent for a while , their hands clasped while the wind wailed through the bare branches of the trees beside the river , and the river itself seemed to murmur sadly beside them .
her hands thrust through the bare branches , gathering scratches as she went , but instead of finding purchase on the earth of the hillside , she fell further forward until her face brushed sharp twigs .
their long knives and their short bows would be strapped to their sides , the dark brown of their clothing making a foil for the gold and crimson of the few leaves that still clung to almost bare branches .
finally she found a fir whose branches trailed in thick profusion on the ground , thick enough to hide whatever was behind them .
the branches parted to let her through , then they closed about her harp and the few bits of food she had left lying next to the trunk .
overhead the trees raised their branches to those stars not obscured by clouds ; crickets sang their hearts out beside the stream , but malin saw nothing , heard nothing , except the somber chorus in his head , karis is coming .

she let go of the branch and felt herself slip under water , this time remembering to allow her gills to work .
a swift kick sent her forward through the water , and she swam around in a small circle , ending the exercise by kicking herself back up to the safety of her branch .
after her fifth circle she found herself exhausted and barely able to hold onto her branch .
mina did nt have the energy to argue , and used her arms to pull her along the branch to the shore , her tail feeling as heavy as lead .

* * * * * * they had nt gone far , the twigs and branches snagging and grabbing at their clothes , making their passage difficult , when they noticed a flicker of movement following .
what was it lizzie thought , her eyes scanning the trees and bushes surrounding them , but seeing nothing and then there just in front of them , high up in a branch filled with dark yellow flowers she spotted it : two large eyes peering down at them inquisitively ?
eye of truth they spent the night camped beneath the overshadowing canopy of a giant fir tree , its large branches protecting them from the cold hard rain that fell all around them , and lizzie awoke the next morning feeling strangely refreshed , if not a little sore .
yes it is ; you can see the path winding in - between the branches .
compared with the wide bright opening of the right hand path the trail that they were now looking at was almost camouflaged ; lost between a tangle of heavily spiked branches and trees that disappeared into an impenetrable darkness .
if it could even be called a path hidden beneath the densely black tangle of branches and twines but now there seemed to be a faint sense of hope as the light teased its way through .
thanks , lucas grinned , stepping onto the lower branches of the first tree and hoisting his body into the small opening in front of him .
it was a tight fit and he pushed and heaved trying to squash his way through when with an almighty crack the branches gave way and he fell unceremoniously head first through the hole into the blackness .
much to their relief , the trail , eased slightly after this ; the vines and branches not so closely compacted and although it was still hard work it was nowhere as bad as when they had first started and even though they still had to squeeze through the gaps there were definitely bigger spaces between each one .
it was still quite a way ahead , but the very fact that they could see light enthused them , and they sped up quickly jumping over the vines and branches that still tried to hinder them .
* * * * * * a piercing scream assaulted lucas ears as they plummeted towards the bottom of the large ravine , branches and leaves whipping them from all sides until at last they were abruptly halted half way down by a large soft bank of moss that tipped them rolling and sliding into a large open tunnel that continued rushing ever downwards as a torrent of water and mud lapped at their bodies swirling them round and round like leaves in a storm drain .
he tried to turn , desperately looking for lizzie but was unable to see anything but the rushing shrubbery , as he was carried helplessly along the slick muddy shoot , the branches snagging at his clothes and face .
lucas checked his map again , scanning the opposite side of the river for any other crossings , but there were none , the trees along the bank growing so close to the water , their branches entwined and twisted like limbs , creating an impenetrable wall which disappeared in both directions , leaving the only way to pass through the ominous black archway ahead of them .
it looked as if it had been woven from the trees , the branches like living breathing creatures lacing themselves together to create a way through and which would close once more behind them as they passed .
it raced onwards as the leaves swarmed around her , following her flight through the trees ; branches clawing at her like monstrous arms intent on catching their prey ; the wind pulling and tearing at her clothes and hair as the horse staggered against its deadly assault .
lizzie felt the terror rise in her chest , the fear crushing her lungs , as through the gaps in the branches she watched the leaves coming to life as they dragged themselves upright ; a dry scratching sound rustling through the mayhem as they began to take on shape and as the horse broke free of the trees , finding the path once more she realised that they had taken on the form of a large feral bird that was now behind them .
they re called screechers , he said as lizzie clambered up the tree to sit on the top most branches that reached just below the giants face .
confused lizzie clambered onto his back , using him to reach the lowest branch of the tree and then hoisted herself up into the canopy above , amazed to see brax leap up after her .
they were almost to the top when unable to support her weight the branch lizzie was standing on gave way with a loud crunching sound , and she felt herself tumbling into the darkness , her scream dying in her throat as a sudden eruption of chaos sounded below .
she closed her eyes tight , her body striking the branches , her arms flailing wildly around her as she crashed towards the ground , waiting for the impact she knew was coming but it never arrived as with a soft shudder she stopped falling .
she had nt hit anything hard , so maybe she was caught on one of the lower branches .
his hands suddenly closed over a large branch and as the beast reached him he stood up brandishing the branch like a club and smashed it into the side of the creatures head .
his hands suddenly closed over a large branch and as the beast reached him he stood up brandishing the branch like a club and smashed it into the side of the creatures head .
he clung on knowing that if he gave in he would be lost , a yell of rage breaking from inside him as with all his remaining strength he swung the branch .
it tore the branch from his hand as he tried to block the assault , its claws gripping onto him dragging him closer as he scrambled in the bushes behind for another branch , but instead his hand closed over something else , a cool metal and his heart gave a small leap of relief .

he felt the muscles tear as the branches tore through his wing , a sharp stabbing bursting through his chest but he never slowed as he crashed into the clearing to stand protectively over lucas .

aiden continued when i entered the mansion all across i could see the dead littered trees with branches , long and spindly , waved in the air , veining like capillaries ; the bark flaked off in spots , diseased with a forging moss that stewed for years and ate its way into the trees innards , killing from the inside out .

perched on the branch sat a magnificent brown and gold falcon .
their branches looked straggly and hung over the driveway in a chaotic manner .

from behind the cover of the branches , i peered down to see his fingers running across the tree trunk .
there was a building visible behind the overhanging branches .
what did you want me to do , get out of the boat and inspect every single rock and tree branch on the ride ?
the icy wind blew gently through the park , gently shifting the branches of the trees , the sound of rustling leaves carrying through the night .
furthermore , as amazed as peyton was by the sheer size of the tree , how the top - most leaves were far too high for her to see , how the circumference of the trunk was like standing in front of the empire state building , peyton was also astonished to see there was fruit growing from the branches .
darius led peyton to the very base of the tree , branches hanging just over their heads , leaves and apples dangling around them .
darius reached up and gently held an apple in the palm of his hand , but did not pluck it from its branch .
a few feet away , she saw a man in an expensive suit standing under the branches of the giant apple tree .
the branch seemed unwilling to give up the apple at first , but then finally let go and snapped back , the leaves rustling quietly .
the business man held the apple in his hand and was staring down at it in wonder , but as peyton watched , a dark substance began to ooze from the branch , from exactly where the apple had been picked .
it spouted from the branch and wrapped itself around the business mans wrist .
he was instantly sucked into the tree branch and was gone , the apple he had picked now returned to its place in the leaves .
dozens of leafy branches began to entwine and quickly formed a large partition .
grinning , peyton walked around the branches to change .
* * * * * when peyton awoke , the first thing she saw were the leaves and branches of the trees hanging above her , rustling gently in the breeze .
his hood was still hiding his face and , as he reached out to push a tree branch out of the way , eve could see his hand stretch out from beneath his sleeve .
tartarus did nt seem to be in any particular hurry , as it moved like a sluggish caterpillar on a tree branch .
glancing behind her , she saw that she had snapped off a low - hanging branch and it now hung limply in the air , barely clinging to the tree by its bark .
quickly , peyton snatched the branch off the tree and started using it as a bat on the spiders .
it worked much more effectively than her fists had , because as she swung the branch like a golf club , the first spider she hit from her leg went sailing through the air , screeching .
peyton began to beat at the other spiders , using the branch to knock them as far away as possible .
she held the branch like it was a louisville slugger , ready to knock one out of the park .
as the joro - gumo sped at peyton , she raised her branch and planted the base of it against the tree from which it had broken , the sharp tip now pointing directly at the fast approaching monster .
as the joro - gumo grew close , inches away and ready to crush peyton under her weight , peyton leaped aside and let the monster slam into the tree , and the branch peyton had positioned there .
looking back over her shoulder , clutching her bleeding arm , peyton saw the joro - gumo stagger away from the tree , a long branch now implanted in its stomach .
then it wrapped its long fingers around the part of the branch that still stuck out and , with a sharp tug and a brief screech , yanked the wood from its belly .
it threw the branch aside and began to approach peyton once more , clicking dangerously .
he slowly surveyed the branches above , knowing instantly that they were in trouble .
perched and hanging from branches , all glaring down at the two of them growling and hissing and beginning to climb down , teeth bared and claws extended .
the ahuizotl took chase , growling and barking and snarling , some running down to the jungle floor to pursue them , while others stayed up in the trees , following through the branches , jumping and swinging like carnivorous monkeys .
one suddenly leaped out of the branches ahead , landing on the path before them .
the force of the blast was so strong , it bent the trees that stood nearby , blowing leaves from branches and threatening to crack tree trunks in two .
he seemed to erupt , a giant column of black water exploding out of the mass and reaching skyward , stretching dozens of feet high , branches breaking off in every direction , clawing at the sky , like a giant , many fingered hand .
the branches immediately began racing through the air towards darius .
he turned his head and saw the hundreds of branches of tartarus racing forward to take him .
the branches struck darius in the back , immediately wrapping themselves around every part of him and beginning to spread over his entire body .
he picked up a tree branch in which to fight off his attackers .
she brushed the sand from her clothes , then started to walk towards the beckoning branches .
this group of children uses small tree branches as their weapons .
we use masers , not t - powers to cut a narrow path through the thick jungle of overgrowth of branch limbs , tree roots , flower vines and thick shrub plants .
i fire and burn the more tree bark , red over story leaves and branch limbs following behind rann .
the small flame explodes high in the skyline with pretty red and blue fiery ashes touching the tip of one red extended tree branch limb inside the blood red jungle .
the fire jumps from tree to tree , branch to branch , limb to limb , plant to plant and leaf to leaf .
the fire jumps from tree to tree , branch to branch , limb to limb , plant to plant and leaf to leaf .
the kids lifted tree limbs and branches to their hands and suspend the objects in the air .
he climbed out of the window and onto a branch of an overhanging tree and slid down , landing on the grass with a thud .
jamie nodded and watched as robert grabbed onto the nearest branch and shimmied his way along the trunk .
jamie grabbed the branch with the crook of his left arm and swung out , holding onto the trunk with his right hand .
he shimmied down the trunk after robert , across another branch on the other side of the tree , and then dropped down onto the ground .
robert disappeared through the bushes and jamie followed as branches tore at his clothes and scratched his face .
she turned to see her dearest friend , leoa , push a tree branch aside and step into the clearing .
the fringe on jinji 's dress pulled against branches , tangling her in the forest as if the trees themselves were trying to stop her .
cutting through the forest was slow moving as they maneuvered around low branches and tall bushes .
the wind licked his face , but there were no swaying branches or whispering leaves .
he moved quickly , searching the length of the twisted branches and bark for some sort of door .
crushed branches and chopped bushes created a line through the normally untouched forest , a track that was easy for rhen to find .
jinji reached for the leather straps hanging from its body , calming the poor animal down before securing it to a low - hanging tree branch .
using the firelight , she searched the ground , but a branch would not be nimble enough to wield against four foes .
qik and eldo took the lead as they traipsed past the beach towards the interior of the island , mostly covered by a thicket of trees and shrubs so overgrown that eldo had to take out his knife and whack at the branches along the trail .
a few minutes later , basha was pushing back a branch in mid - stride , but he quickly skidded to a halt .
pushing aside the branch had given him a clear view of the face - off taking place in the clearing ahead .
the mid - afternoon sun was starting to fade , now dropping more steadily towards the western horizon as basha and monika sat around on the ground , waiting for eldos return as the falcons grabbed a perch on a tree branch .
fato and frigo argued with each other for a moment before they finally quieted and leaned down from their tree branch so that they would be able to hear things better .
he rubbed talans mane before he turned around to see deja trudging into the clearing monika dismounted and tried to comfort her horse as fato and frigo flew in , roosted themselves onto a tree branch , and yawned as they inquired about dinner .
fato squawked as he alighted on a branch right above eldos head , with the man hidden in the shadows cast by the fire , and he shouted , eldo , there you are !
fato chuckled and nodded as he fluttered off the branch .
eldo chose to sit on a spot beneath the overhanging branches of a tree , leaning against the trunk until basha walked up to inform him , thank you for helping me earlier .
eldo sighed as he looked up at the branches .
they tore off a few branches from the bush to ignite a fire , which everyone gathered around to dispel the last frigidity of their harrowing experience .
the falcons nested themselves on the branches , clumped close together after their long separation .
grabbing onto the lowest branch , i press my feet against the trunk , hoist myself up , and climb high enough that i can glimpse into the backyard .
i find a wide spot on one of the thick , lower branches and straddle it .
fiona looked at the thick rope hanging from a heavy branch overhead .
the branch quivered and the leaves rattled .
the branches soon canopied overhead blocking out the white points of light above and the sky itself .
it seemed like they were lost in the shadows of the low hanging branches and tree trunks when the night sky popped into view .
i shield my eyes with one hand as the pulses reach a peak , and the bright yellow light stays on , and when i let my hand down again there are six tentacles now , and they re flailing wildly , like branches in a hurricane .
i run over to the tree and jump to grab a branch , pulling it down as i land .
i twist the branch , hoping to break it off , but it does nt want to break so easily .
i really have to fight it , twisting , and pulling with both hands before the branch breaks , leaving me about twenty inches of narrow stick .
once i have my hand inside i pass the branch through with the other hand .
i remember the first time i climbed a tree , and could nt get back down until my dad lifted me off the branch i was gripping .
the plants scattered around in the untouched strip of land ; larger ones towering into the sky and smaller ones within their midst , hidden under thick hanging branches .
birds sing sweet melodies , hidden within branches of towering trees , their beaks raised towards the sky .
beckwyn leaped up and effortlessly pulled himself on top of a tree branch in order to sit comfortably .
he jumped to the lowest branch and climbed up a few more just to be safe .
a few loosened branches and leaves fell on top of them as if to attest to the strong jar they had just experienced .
so , once it stopped swaying back and forth , he jumped down to a lower branch .
when the creature was just a few feet away from him , dane hurdled vertically into the air , grabbed onto the lowest branch of the tree and lifted up his legs .
dane held firmly onto the branch as the tree swayed back and forth for several seconds .
as soon as it was relatively stable , dane hoisted himself up to sit on the branch .
as it loudly snorted , dane was glad bryn stayed perfectly still on her branch .
dane jumped back up into the tree and climbed the last few branches so he was at eye - level with her .
its branches were bare and jutted out in different directions .
a ring of metal surrounded the tree as it connected each branch in a perfect circle .
beckwyn found a place to sit next to him on his branch and said , so how long do you plan on staying up here this time ?
they moved down the tree jumping from branch to branch .
they moved down the tree jumping from branch to branch .
the barks and branches scratched me in the process , and when i landed , it was in kens arms .
cherry blossom trees stood on my right , branches buried by beautiful pink petals .
branches of the trees were broken , their trunks bent in an odd shape .
i tried not to make a sound as i slipped between the branches and bushes that separated us .
i found myself wishing i had put on a long sleeve shirt as my skin began to itch due to the countless branches that scraped against me .

they both had collected a bunch of dry twigs and small branches in the surrounding woods .
he goes in search of some branches in the forest for some kindling .
he does nt go very far from his site while doing this though as every time he finds two or three little branches he brings them back and throws them in the pit .
and he keeps plenty of his kindling branches on the side in reserve .
at its top , strands of iron curled in wide spirals like branches of a dead tree , forming the bars of a spherical cage .

bringlen recognized it , but before he could recall the boys name , tree branches were wrapping themselves around him , grabbing his arms , slithering across his chest and his neck , pulling him backward , lifting him into the air .
the branches were under the control of some dark spell .
bringlen gasped for breath as the branch around his neck tightened .
bringlen cried , squirming in the branches , trying to find some air .
the branches loosened and bringlen took in a full breath .
sorren flicked his scepter to the side , and the branches flew out from under bringlen .
quove seemed to enjoy flying ahead of them , hopping from branch to branch , every now and then swooping down to catch some snack on the forest floor , an insect or a small mouse .

outside , the night sky was hidden by the thick branches of the forests coniferous trees .
baylet glared up at the branches above .
sorren noticed quove not far away , sitting on a thin branch in the tree ahead of them , pecking at insects .
he took another bite of his apple and watched quove on her branch .
sorren studied the branches above .
thin branches , thin green needles , slivers of a cloudy blue sky .
with his flesh - and - blood hand , he reached out to run his fingers along the bark of the passing trees and through the branches that twisted out toward him , letting the needles stab his skin and make his fingers sticky .
shed linger on a branch , then fly to another , pausing before flying again .
finally , quove flew to a branch and kept there , turning back to face sorren .
he turned to the branches above and whispered a spell to them .
it was hardly comfortable being wrapped in the branches of a pine tree with all its needles , but sorren was more focused on staying as quiet as possible .
turning his gaze from the rire , he saw a large owl perched on a branch by his side , gray and black stripes running along its feathers , rings of gray framing its pale yellow eyes .
sorren whispered a spell to the branches and they slowly lowered him to the forest floor .
the smell was foul , but sorren kept a small piece of pine branch in his other hand , holding it to his nose when he needed relief .
* * * beyond the bonfires clearing , invisible in the blackness of the forests shadows , four zolen soldiers stood behind trees , eyes peering through the branches .
sorren looked skyward , but all was twisted branches and shadow above .
more small leather pouches burst through the pine branches , rolling through the air at sorren .
branches snapped and plunged to the ground as ash continued raining down .

the canopy looked like branches that were bending to the will of the bed , creating cover for the top .
meanwhile he prayed the branches would continue to hold him .
the bed had been so masterfully crafted to look like wood that he had n't noticed the distinctly hollow feel to the branches until he reached the top .
thomas peeked between the branches as he fought to keep a grip on sides of the bed .
if she had looked up , she would have seen a mess of branches with a pair of eyes staring down at her .
thomas was so engrossed that he did n't notice the branches starting to give .
the ground was soft , and the trees branches reached out above his head to shield him from the elements .

it sits 20 feet in the air between the branches of two towering trees .

but strange , furtive noises issued from the branches , noises that raised the hairs on the back of his neck .
it had clearly been hacked from a fallen branch or sapling .
the drawing on the map was rough , but conformed in spirit to the eruption of limbs , branches , and trunks that made up the tree .
trees hung close to the road and a couple of branches scraped over the top of the car .

yeah , said maeve , nodding toward the desk behind her at a small green circlet that seemed to be made of marble and inlaid with an elaborate design of amber leaves and branches .

for behold , i am not a faerie , and thus have never the tree stopped in mid - sentence , giving frotwoot an empathetic hiss as he finally cleared the branches only to go crashing through the big glass ceiling above them .
said frotwoot , grunting distractedly as he quickly but carefully began to descend down the rows and rows of branches .
i do nt know , said frotwoot , pressing on to the next branch .
just before those last two words , frotwoot had breathed in sharply as he slipped and fell from an apparently not - close - enough branch .
rather than using the shade offered by the spreading branches as the ideal place to sit and talk or read , all the girls and boys gathered there were excitedly peering up into the leafy covering , shouting out words of encouragement or warning .
with her free hand , chrissy forced si to duck down beneath the low spreading branches .
to either side of them , however , the intertwined branches and twigs of the bushes formed a seemingly impenetrable barrier .

on the other side of the sidewalk lay a long branch , most likely snapped off during the fall storms .
he hopped around for a bit before slipping the branch under his arm .
he got three steps before the branch broke on him , sending him to the ground again .
he played it as a child up in the trees , where each circle was rather a branch that they landed the batons upon .
he let out a sigh , then concentrated on taking in the whole scene , memorizing the subtle shades of the stone , the stillness of the trees , the shady spots and the light gilding the rich blue of a flower he did not recognize , and another plant with many small branches topped by pink blooms .

they headed back to the cabin in silence , and alex was barely aware of the wildlife around her : the redwoods and cedars shaking off their pines whenever a squirrel jumped from one branch to the next , or a bird descended to drop off another essential for its nest .
she admired the tall cypresses they strolled past or gasped whenever a squirrel leapt from one branch to another and it seemed as if he would nt make it .
hoping that would nt happen , she shuffled behind alex slowly , through the forest of cedars and redwoods , fallen branches , and off - white snow .

those were the noises in her city , the noises to which she had become accustomed to since she was a child , but that seemed to have been banished from that place in the middle of a forest where the only thing that could be heard was the whistle of the wind through the trees , the clattering of branches ... she went back inside the house and opened her backpack to get her mobile .

i reflected on this ; and , by touching the various branches , i discovered the cause , and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood , that i might dry it , and have a plentiful supply of fire .
i covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves , and placed wet branches upon it ; and then , spreading my cloak , i lay on the ground , and sunk into sleep .
i observed this also , and contrived a fan of branches , which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished .
it was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest , my former residence , the rain - dropping branches , and dank earth .
the cold stars shone in mockery , and the bare trees waved their branches above me : now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness .
i lighted the dry branch of a tree , and danced with fury around the devoted cottage , my eyes still fixed on the western horizon , the edge of which the moon nearly touched .
` ` i continued to wind among the paths of the wood , until i came to its boundary , which was skirted by a deep and rapid river , into which many of the trees bent their branches , now budding with the fresh spring .
she was just noting that there did n't seem to be as many of the twinkling lights here as there were visible in magnetawan , and wondering why that would be , when the snap of a branch caught her ear .
moaning , sam allowed herself to be distracted and slid her hands into his hair to hold on as he was bowed over her like a branch , leaning her back over the boulder .
she was just debating whether to go inside and get herself something to drink when the snap of a branch drew her gaze to the path , and she saw bricker moving across the yard toward her .
her fingers closed over what felt to be several thin branches of a bush .
dani ignored the sting as the branches ran through her fingers , stripping the leaves along the way .
desperate to stop herself , she tightened her grasp , but the branches immediately snapped under the full brunt of her weight .
decker 's answer was to lift the long branch he 'd found in the woods .
he began snapping the branch into three pieces .
it looked like lengths of a thick branch had been punched through their chests where their hearts would be .
it was the branches through their chests that had her mind running around inside her head like a small dog chasing its tail .
` ` they stuck branches in the bodies of those men who took us , and - are they csis ? ''
the trees were old and large , their branches stretching like a canopy over the road and blocking out the stars over - head .
the trees were old here and tall , their leafy branches blocking out the sunlight so that it was dark and there was no ground cover .
he was there somewhere , eshe knew it , waiting , either behind one of the wide tree trunks or even up a tree in the branches overhead .
the branches of the thick evergreens were coated with new snow that sparkled in the snowmobile 's headlights ; but it was the oaks and maples that truly shone , their branches were encased in ice from previous snowfalls that had melted , and they glittered like diamonds when the light hit them .

the bush there was crushed , with broken branches , and loose leaves lying around it .
low - hanging branches curled out of his way , bent from his path by the heat rolling off him with each stride .
leaves crackled and withered above his head , all around him branches scorching from his heat .
she took a step forward , only to back off a second later as blackened leaves and pine needles fell from their branches around him and turned to white ash at his feet .
the range rover rocked and bounced , branches scraping its sides and slapping at the windshield and windows like spiny tentacles .
she tossed and turned , watching the black branches scratch at the windows like skeletal hands , and wondered what shane was doing .
a dried branch wedged in between the rocks aboveher .
once into the woods , the canopy of branches cut off the moonlight .
its lowest brancheswere much too high to climb in the regular way , but a maple had fallen against it and remainedwedged , branches interlocked with the giant , forming a steep but climbable ramp .
but she did n't seem to be able to do anything but cling to her branch .
maggie shifted on her branch .
maggie let out a shaky breath and leaned herhead against a branch .
maggie glanced atp.j . , who was swinging her thin legs over the edge of a branch .
i started to shake , my eyes clamped shut as i remembered the crashing of branches and the sound when the horses and dogs grew close as i had tried to escape .
it could ' ve been a tree branch , blowing in the wind , or it might ' ve been my imagination .
it clutched a branch in one claw ... only the branch had five fingers , and the tattered remains of a shirt clung to it .
it clutched a branch in one claw ... only the branch had five fingers , and the tattered remains of a shirt clung to it .
through the branches , the sky blazed with stars .
its branches were twisted and bent , empty of leaves , and it looked more dead than alive .
cursing , i grabbed the branches and dragged the old tree farther onto the road , expecting the men to come racing over the rise at any second .
the men swung off , and one walked to the tree , giving it an angry kick that made the branches rattle .
zeke waved it off and stood , grabbing a hanging branch a bit unsteadily .
` ` there , '' i muttered to zeke , pointing to the branches of an old pine tree .
ruth and zeke were still up on the platform , sitting side by side , when i returned with the wheelbarrow full of logs and branches .
four of them , including the woman in the tattered dress , crouched among the trees and dripping branches of the forest .
the wind whipped around me , tossing my hair and clothes , rattling the branches above .
two hours past midnight on the second night , i finally heard voices , drifting ahead of me through the trunks and branches , and my heart leaped .
the road , crumbling and full of holes , was still treacherous , but it was easier than hacking through brush and tripping over rocks and branches .
the sound of the wind and creaking branches faded away as i concentrated solely on the boys in front of me .
every so often , my leg would brush something beneath the surface of the water , a branch or a pole or the roof of a car , making me wonder what else was down there .
it shone above the branches , tantalizingly close .
leaves and branches were frozen beneath a layer of ice filling the shallow pool , and the rusty hulk of a car lay on its side at the edge .
indirect sunlight would n't harm us , but it was still unpleasant , even in the shade , knowing that if the light shifted or a gust of wind tossed the branches , you 'd be in a great deal of pain .
all my vampire instincts were screaming at me to stop when i stepped out from under the branches , feeling the weak rays of dawn beating down on me .
i kicked at a tree branch with my boot .
the faint light of a lamppost a little ways away filtered through the branches of a tree above us , lighting up his face as he grinned in what he probably thought was a friendly manner .
yet , despite his flippant tone , there was a hard look on his face that i rarely saw , a look that said even if there was an army standing in front of us , he would still defy them with a tree branch if they tried to lay a hand on me .
` ` are you seriously threatening me with a branch ? ''
` ` but spirit would ' ve been a lot more effective than a branch . ''
the tree branches were coated in ice .
a partial silver moon gleamed down at us through some branches .
something chattered at them from a nearby branch .
' ` ` one for sorrow , '' said agnes , watching the bird hop along a branch .
the three magpies landed together on another tree and chased one another through the branches , chattering loudly .
she managed to get one boot on a branch while holding on for dear life to the branch above , but that left her other foot standing on the broomstick , which was beginning to drift sideways and causing her to do what even ballerinas ca n't do without some training .
she managed to get one boot on a branch while holding on for dear life to the branch above , but that left her other foot standing on the broomstick , which was beginning to drift sideways and causing her to do what even ballerinas ca n't do without some training .
agnes got the other leg on to the branch , which creaked .
she tried to swat the nearest one , and it fluttered on to a higher branch while she struggled to get her balance back .
when the branch stopped rocking she moved further along , gingerly , trying to ignore the enraged birds , and looked at the nest .
it spent most of its time asleep in any case , but when forced to find food it tended to sit on a branch out of the wind somewhere and wait for something to die .
rain dripped off the branches .
around some old mounds , half buried in brambles , it shook the wet branches of a single thorn tree , and shredded the curling smoke that drifted up through the roots .
oats ducked between the branches of two firs and threw another armful of dead wood on the flames .
this took some time and involved a branch from a nearby tree and , despite oats 's best efforts , granny 's first foot came out of its boot .
the wowhawk swooped past and landed on the branch of a dead tree a few yards away .
they were perched on a branch over the road .
it drifted silently over the shadowy woods , curved over the trees , and landed suddenly on a branch beside a cottage in a clearing .
eagles were perched high on some nearby tree branches , watching for meals of their own , and half dome peak provided a magnificent backdrop that was almost too perfect to believe was real .
they had painted the room like it was a work of art : light green rolling hills , blue sky with fluffy white clouds , huge trees with branches that extended from one corner to another .
alexander pulled back a branch and disappeared into the brush .
i pulled a branch back and crept inside the thick brush .
i managed to carefully step over a few stumps , downed branches , and fallen trees .
just then i heard a branch snap .
i could barely see what looked like two frightened squirrels racing up a branch , running away from a winged creature .
a weeping willow was draped with its branches over a rectangular wooden table covered with a black lace tablecloth and set for two with fine china and sterling silverware .
if she were n't shy and short and immature looking ... she reached the top of the ridge and grabbed at a branch to keep her balance .
she felt stiff and clumsy and the shivering made it hard to climb over fallen trees and branches .
that was all she could see anyway , the next dark rock protruding from the snow , the next fallen branch to get over or around .
above , overhanging branches formed a snowy canopy .
after that came a long time of stumbling and staggering , over branches , around trees , on and on .
and while she was lying on her back , arms out , making the imprint of the angel 's wings , a tree branch above her decided to shrug off its load of snow .
she hoped no one was watching , but she had the feeling of eyes staring from between bare branches and out of shadows .
frozen tree branches creaked like creatures in pain .
a branch snagged in her hair , forcing her to stop again .
it took some time to realize she was barefoot , and never once had either foot come down on a dry branch or small rock .
at the edge of the clearing before the cottage , three large deer rested beneath the swaying branches of a tree .
overhead the branches swayed and danced .
outside the wind rattled at the windows , howled low , rubbed branches against the walls .
a low moan rose , echoed through grotesquely swaying branches .
instantly the wind blew rain into the cabin , a high - pitched moan rising above the scraping branches .
mikhail laughing , pushing jacques from a tree branch playfully .
for strength shea clutched at an overhead tree branch .
she buried her face in the crook of her arm , hanging on grimly to the branch above her .
` ` there are marks on the ground , as if a branch has been dragged over it .
with a little sigh he carried the bodies of the hunters to an open area and carefully collected what dry branches he could find .
the canopy of waving branches , the way the rays of the moon spilled over the trees and bathed the streams in silver .
mikhail dissolved effortlessly , streamed down through the heavy branches of the fir tree .
byron caught at the branch with a tight grip .
she could hear the creaks and rustles of the house acutely , the sway of branches outside the window .
with her acute sense of hearing , she could hear every rustling in the bushes , every swaying of the branches , the beat of wings in the sky .
raven picked up a broken branch and flung it at him .
she threw another branch , then followed it up with a small rock .
mikhail pried her fingers loose from the branch she held like a club , allowed it to fall .
with his strange old - world courtesy , mikhail held up a branch for her to pass beneath .
he staggered , caught at a thick tree branch , and sat down abruptly .
leaves blew across the footpath in a steady stream , lighter branches swayed and dipped as she passed .
the wind unleashed its deadly power , sent leaves , twigs , and small branches flying through the air like missiles .
wolves boiled out of the forest , circled the meadow , glowing eyes fixed on the three people dodging branches that were hurtling through the air .
the stars overhead played hide and seek through the canopy of leaves and branches .
mikhail glided silently to the heavy branches above raven 's head .
a gentle wind lazily pushed the clouds , brushed at heavy branches and tried vainly to disperse the smell of smoke that lingered persistently in the forest .
every insect , every rustle in the underbrush , every separate sway of a branch lightened the terrible dread in her heart , pushed the fearful memories a little farther away .
he landed on the low branch of a tree and changed to human form as he jumped the remaining seven feet to earth .
` ` there 's blood everywhere and smashed branches .
the storm rolled in over the forest fast , with wild winds kicking up leaves and swaying branches .
andre was laughing , flinging himself from the branch of a tree atop a woman attempting to crawl away from him .
a six - foot wingp spread and he glided to the high branch of a nearby tree , razor - sharp talons digging into a branch .
a six - foot wingp spread and he glided to the high branch of a nearby tree , razor - sharp talons digging into a branch .
leaves rustled and branches hit together with a muffled clack .
even as the tree trunk groaned and splintered and the earth rolled , there was a terrible sound as the tree broke in half , knocking the top from the tree and driving the large , heavy branches straight down on them .
alexandria felt the blow to her head , the branch that picked her up and swept her down with alarming force .
she was pinned down under a heavy branch , her legs trapped , one hurting so much she had to fight back nausea .
fur brushed her face as a huge wolf pushed through the maze of branches to inspect her wound .
` ` alexandria is trapped beneath these branches . ''
he searched frantically through the branches of the fallen tree for a glimpse of alexandria .
he raced forward like a madman , breaking through branches as if they were mere twigs , his throat tight and his heart pounding .
we have to lift the heavier branches off her . ''
he leapt forward to smash his way to her side , waiting for mikhail so they could easily float the remaining branches from her body .
the branches around them trembled and the air thickened .
blood still trickled down one side of alexandria 's face as she picked her way through the branches to francesca .
there was no wind , yet the branches of the trees around them swayed subtly .
you pushed her away from the larger branches . ''
and when i saw you lying so still covered by the branches , my emotions swung out of control .
the trees were no longer bent and twisted , but stood proudly , branches raised to the sky .
he reached down to touch one of the budding branches from a young sapling that had n't been there a few hours earlier .
she tripped on a branch buried in the snow , and glanced around astonished to realize she had been walking the entire time and had no idea where she was .
roped muscles and a flexible spine allowed the stocky jaguar to leap from boulder to log and even take to the tree branches when necessary .
the world was white and sparkling , snow weighing down the branches of the trees in all directions .
the trees were transformed , branches laden with white crystals , so that they glittered with millions of gems .
she could hear the branches of the trees brushing against the side of the cabin , see the moon lighting the room with a silvery glow .
the leopard somersaulted to avoid the lethal charge , heading toward the cover of the trees , knowing its huge , feathered opponent would not have easy maneuverability in the canopy of branches .
the wind blew through the thick stand of trees , and the branches swayed , danced , and bent low to sweep the ground .
even as they walked together in perfect harmony , breathing in the fresh mountain air , listening to the forest creatures , the creak of the swaying branches , and a rushing stream nearby , julian could think of only one thing .
the wind rose around them , gusting at the branches overhead .
she took his breath away , standing there naked in the moonlight , branches swaying all around her .
they looked at one another and then began to run together , leaping over logs and branches , winding through the forest with consummate grace .
the night air groaned with the effort to support the gathering weight of the owls flying in , settling on branches all around them .
the blackened liquid began to obscenely form the parody of an arm , then stretched farther into a diabolical , shadowy hand that began to furtively crawl across pine needles and over fallen branches to reach its goal .
this time the undead 's servant was turned away from him , but the leopard merely vaulted into the branches above his head , then dropped on the fiend , burying its canines deep , crushing the throat .
then he opened the earth above them to reveal the swaying canopy of branches and the night that belonged to him .
he tucked his wings under him and walked along a branch , his clawed talons digging into the wood .
she laughed again , this time dislodging herself from the tree branch .
a male leopard , large and well - muscled , moved out into the open and leapt with casual ease onto a low tree branch .
the leopard jumped soundlessly from the branch and padded after her .
the twisted , blackened ruins of what had once been a beautiful forest looked suddenly sinister , as tree branches reached out - like eerie stick people .
the robed shadows with their sunken pits for eyes went motionless and silent , their upraised branches growing sharpened points , several knives protruding from each stump .
gerald dragged terry through the meadow to where the car was parked beneath some naked branches .
overhead an owl settled onto a tree branch , wings fluttering before spreading out and swooping toward the ground .
she blinked and found that the stalagmites , large columns of minerals deposited from water dripping over the centuries , had twisted into thick tree trunks , branches spreading across the chamber floor to twine with one another and form a forest .
as her vision cleared , she could see a large tree with a labyrinth of roots and a jungle of wide - reaching branches standing before her .
mist of varying colors swirled through and around the branches .
there were a few dark knots in the trunk and branches and one or two places where it may have lost a limb over time , but the tree appeared healthy .
the closer she got to the tree , the more missing branches she spotted , and beneath the tree , held within the cage of roots , old dead limbs lay like broken bodies in a mass grave .
faint , shallow marks were burned into the trunk leading up toward the branches where new life waited .
she could see the two branches were blackened and hollow , twisted from some disease .
above them were several other brand - new souls as well , clinging to relatively healthy branches , but she could already see signs of the unknown disease eating at the limbs .
the path led up toward the high branches , but also followed the trunk down to the maze of roots below the earth .
a swarm of tremors shook the tree from branches to root deep within the ground .
swaying branches interlocked overhead , blocking most of the moonlight .
the branch above her head cracked and broke off , rocketing toward her head like a missile .
the branch slammed into the ground exactly where she 'd been standing .
the leaves on the trees closest to him began to tremble and the branches swayed with alarm .
he raced through the trees , powerful wings flapping hard , skimming the edge of branches , a suicide run through the dense trees .
he sensed the disturbance increasing and slowed to a more acceptable speed , moving the way an owl would naturally among the branches of the trees and gaining more height to spot prey .
the branches interlocked , providing a seemingly impenetrable canopy .
he dropped lower as he slipped between the branches , making his body smaller , uncaring that the use of power might give away his presence .
vikirnoff settled the owl 's body silently onto a thick , twisted branch high above the ground , folding his wings and watching for movement below him .
the tree branch beneath vikirnoff 's talons trembled as power swelled in the air .
his strength was enormous and the snarling creature hit a tree trunk with such force it shook the branches .
natalya sat on the branch and glared down at the blood - smeared vampire .
one blade stuck in the branch she 'd been sitting in , but she climbed fast going up the tree , utilizing the close canopy as a shield .
natalya climbed down the tree to the lower branches , careful to stay off the ground , but determined to keep henrik 's wrath and attention squarely on her .
vikirnoff caught at a tree branch as he plummeted toward the forest floor .
there were so many on some of the branches that the limbs drooped with the weight .
pine trees grew in abundance and some low branches partially dipped into the wide bog , so that needles floated on the surface along with the thick vegetation .
there was a little moonlight shining through the woods and the branches were illuminated in a ghostly silver .
the branches in the pine forest clacked together and needles flew like sharpened darts through the air .
she saw falcon shove sara back as a huge monster of a bear dropped from the branches of a tree directly onto his shoulders .
over her head tree branches swayed gently , the leaves glittering a strange silver .
she ran her hand over the bark of a small branch .
an occasional owl flitted to branches near them out of idle curiosity .
the wind beat at the window , the branches of trees sweeping against the house in a kind of fury .
the branches slapped at her truck as it rushed through the trees along the winding road .
an owl sat in the high branches of the tree to her left , completely still and very aware of every movement in the forest .
overhead , jacques , in the shape of the owl , launched himself from the branches and flew straight at the undead , talons outstretched .
sasha was already in the trees , the remainder of her carcass in the branches , cached for the following day .
he had tried to drop from the branches of a tree as he had seen the older animals doing but had landed feet in front of his intended victim , inadvertently sending it scurrying out of reach .
holding out her arms , she sang to them , coaxed them , her throaty warbling luring the birds from their branches and nests .
he was in the middle of shape - shifting , his body accommodating the muscular form of a panther even as he was leaping for a low tree branch .
tempest ducked low beneath the canopy of low , sweeping branches , trying hard to be quiet and not rustle any bushes .
the bus moved sluggishly in the muddy track , rotted tree branches floating along in the water , bumping against the sides .
at times she chose a path so narrow that the tree branches scraped the sides of the trailer with a screeching metallic sound she thought might haunt her for all time .
thinking it was a branch , she started to turn .
the wind was tugging at the treetops , so that they bowed and swayed , branches waving up at her .
a large raptor landed on the branch above aidan 's head and slowly folded its wings .
she could hear rain falling in a steady pattern and wind blowing through the trees , making their branches rake the walls .
the vampire flew backward away from lucian , while tree branches and rocks whistled through the air , aimed directly at him .
lucian observed the ease with which he climbed the branches of the trees overlooking the stone wall .
the wind was blowing fiercely through the branches and leaves , creating a whistling that sounded curiously like a moan .
at five the wind was strong enough to bend the trees and throw the branches into a wild frenzy of dancing .
at once the wind picked up , the storm increasing in strength , becoming violent , hurtling branches and foliage in all directions .
overhead , the tree branches shook and trembled .
the canopy was thick and leaves slapped at them as they plummeted through , skimming branches and hurtling toward the ground at such a fast speed she thought they would crash .
she paused to get her bearings before taking to the trees and running along the twisting highway of branches high above the forest floor .
she stumbled twice , tripped on a branch and leapt hastily to the ground .
riordan chose the shape of a smaller cat , a civet , able to move fast on the highway of branches above the forest floor .
he was much more cautious as he leapt from branch to branch .
he was much more cautious as he leapt from branch to branch .
the little cat leapt over a twig holding a spray of leaves and nearly did n't make it , almost somersaulting into a thick snake coiled around a branch .
riordan sank his nails deep into the branch to keep from going to her .
it was easier to fly above the canopy then to try to wind his way through the thick branches and leaves .
the jaguar sprang into the lower branches of a tree and disappeared entirely into the canopy .
every kind of plant climbed the trunks of the trees and twisted around branches , creating a jungle of foliage .
they took to the overhead highway , the tangle of branches high up in the canopy that allowed them to travel fast and in secret .
the jaguar stumbled , nearly tumbling from the branches .
she lost her jaguar self , gagging , choking , catching the branch of the tree for support to keep from falling .
a jaguar male , obviously trusting in the forest warning system , rested in the tree branches to the left of the cave , sleeping in the late afternoon , tired from the two - day rush through the forest .
she heard the roar of the jaguar as it leapt from the branches onto solange .
jasmine ran to kneel by solange while riordan eased the teeth of the jaguar carefully out of juliette 's neck and tossed the heavy body of the cat away as if it were no more than a bothersome branch .
over gabriel 's head a large tree branch cracked ominously and plummeted to earth .
francesca felt her heart slam painfully , the air catch in her lungs , but gabriel merely lifted his hand so the branch was deflected away from him , flung off to the side a good distance from where he remained so calmly .
he shrugged and cut through the park along a dark pathway , holding aside the low - lying branches to prevent them from hitting francesca .
the trees began to shake under the onslaught , first twigs and then branches shaking loose to hurtle through the sky toward gabriel .
the sky rained leaves and dirt and branches over the small hill .
gabriel leaped into the air with the largest branch , camouflaged by its bulk .
around him were broken headstones , shattered by the lightning bolts and the branches and wicked wind .
the vampire stood frozen , trying to decide his next move even as he attempted to protect himself from the flying objects coming at his body , gabriel came in behind the branch , hitting the vampire so hard , the blow drove the creature backward with gabriel 's fist embedded deep in his chest cavity .
he could see the branches of the trees swaying gently , see her beautiful , knowing eyes staring into his blackened soul .
the branches of the trees swayed slightly in syncopation .
the second ghoul struck from behind , creeping in a stealthy manner up to gregori , then swinging a huge tree branch at the back of his head .
turtles shared the fallen , rotting logs with young alligators , and snakes slithered or wound themselves , sated and drowsy , along branches .
the wind outside rattling the tree branches .
corinne was silent , listening to the sounds of the house , the wind outside the window , the branches swaying and dancing .
dayan took to the air , shape - shifting as he did so , a streamlined raptor racing through the canopy of branches to reach the undead before it managed to get to its lair .
the leopard leapt casually from the forest floor to a tree branch six feet above its head .
he could hear her excited laughter as she leapt up on a thick tree branch and lifted her muzzle to the wind and rain .
corinne leapt from the branch because she could .
hanging off a branch by a thick rope was a tire swing .
i was trying for a branch , but at the last second i was afraid i would n't make it . ''
a silky anteater climbing in the branches of a tree paused to gaze at him with a wary eye .
he spotted hundreds of frogs and lizards dotting the branches and trunks as he swept by .
the bird settled high in the branches of tall tree on the edge of a man - made clearing .
the eagle watched , motionless , hidden in the thick , twisted branches and umbrella leaves up above the clearing .
the eagle slid noiselessly through the tree branches and settled on a broad limb high above the forest floor .
birds hid among the thick , twisted branches , high up in the canopy in hopes of relief .
tree frogs dotted the trunks and branches while lizards used leaves for umbrellas .
he moved in silence , keeping pace in the sky , winding through the labyrinth of branches with ease .
lianas , looped and twisted into tangles , were full of crevices and grooves , ideal hiding places for the animals taking shelter up and down the trunks and in the branches .
the harpy eagle could easily rip prey from a branch , dropping silently from a lookout perch to snatch an unwary victim .
with his wings spread wide , it seemed impossible for the powerful predator to maneuver the tight passageways of the canopy , with the knotted and twisted branches and the hanging lianas , but the eagle did so with majestic ease , keeping pace with the predator on the ground .
twice she had to take to the aerial highway , using the branches to pass over fast - moving water .
breathing heavily , she settled once more on the branch .
in desperation , without truly thinking her decision through , solange shifted , right there in the crook of the kapok tree , and , clinging to the branch , called out to the only man who mattered to her .
the macaws stood out on the branches , staring at him curiously as he sailed to the ground and shifted into his own form .
a monkey screamed and leapt , as if burned , from the lower branches to the next tree over .
abruptly it uncoiled , reaching out for an interlocking branch from the neighboring tree .
frogs and lizards abandoned the branches , and insects made a mass exodus .
a large snake that was twisted around the branches lifted its head and slithered along the trunk , uncoiling its long body as it descended to the ground and slithered almost to drago 's feet .
a fourth emerged from the twisted branches of the blackened fig tree that drago had come from , and dominic automatically put him down as the weakest link .
she was already back in the trees , the jaguar climbing into the crook of a branch , high up beneath an umbrella of thick leaves .
she had n't been able to confirm that , but she often lay in the branches of the trees for hours watching over the facility -- a terrible risk certainly , yet one she hoped would yield even a single piece of important information .
solange padded softly along the labyrinth of interlocking branches forming the arboreal highway .
she leapt from the branch , hand outstretched , catching at the thick , woody liana vines hanging from all the trees and swinging hard , using her forward momentum to drive her across to the next vine .
she managed to pull herself onto a branch , shifting her weight to give herself the best leap toward the vines hanging between the next two trees .
she glanced over her shoulder as she jumped , and saw the huge black jaguar running along the branches of the tree she 'd vacated .
he was too heavy to use the vines , forced to run along the branches .
her advantage was the air , and she went for the trees without interlocking branches , forcing him to slow in his chase , making him go to the forest floor to follow her progress .
her body slammed into the branch hard , hands reaching desperately for a purchase .
she missed with her left hand but her right caught the gnarled branch firmly .
she managed to grip with her left and kept moving , using her weight as a pendulum to swing herself onto the branch .
she ran along the branches , fitting an arrow into her crossbow .
she threw herself precariously onto the next branch , scrambling to get across the shaking limb .
her hands missed the branch and her heart somersaulted .
her outstretched arms slammed into a thin branch .
her body hit a branch and broke it in half , sending the heavy jaguar careening against the trunk and finally off of her .
head down , she somersaulted off the branch and into the raging water .
a fallen tree lay partially across the river , branches sweeping out .
she gathered herself as she neared the outer branches .
as the river sucked her under , she threw her hands out and managed to hook her arm around a branch .
sending up a silent prayer that the branch was strong enough to hold against the pull of the water , she gathered her strength for the next step .
before she could drag herself onto the branches , she heard a chilling noise .
for one terrible moment she nearly lost her grip on the branch , shocked that she was n't alone and that the voice was distinctly jaguar .
she tried to pull herself into the tangle of branches .
as she inched her way inside the labyrinth of branches , her shin hit a thick limb beneath the water line and she quickly wrapped her legs around it .
she had to let go of the death grip she had on the higher branch .
it was terrifying to even consider such a folly , and it took several seconds to force herself to allow her fingers to slide along the branch until her body was no longer stretched out in plain sight .
she strained harder and managed to curl her fingers around the underwater branch .
if they did n't leave soon , she was going to lose her ability to hold on to branches .
hate lived and breathed in solange , and she despised being weak and helpless , cowering in a swollen river , clinging like a child to the tree branches .
again she feared releasing her grip , but she was in a better position in the mass of branches beneath the water to climb , if she could make her leaden body move .
she loosened her hand first , flexing her fingers beneath the water before she reached for one of the branches just above the surface .
she grasped the branch tightly and let go with her other hand .

i knew it , and i felt it , and i saw the image of us in your eye , distractingly , as the pleasure nevertheless flushed through me , making me believe i was alive , somehow connected to fields of clover or trees with roots deeper in the earth than the branches they raise to the welkin above .
i saw the desert and a town of huts with roofs of palm branches .
once again the petals fell , petals of all colors , and peacock feathers waved about us , and branches of palm , and there was singing in great lusty bursts , and the sound of a riotous drum , and she smiled looking down from where she stood , her face remarkably flushed and mobile and human , her black - painted eyes sweeping over her worshipers .
i stood among the branches , and then leapt to the next , and then to the top of the wall , encrusted with vine .
the night would never desert me , and it was faithful in every open door with its intruding grass , and the veined olive branches rising to catch the light of the moon .
stefan watched , foolish and uncomprehending and just not fast enough , as damon , quicker than him till the last , dashed toward the huge tree and flung bonnie , light as dandelion fluff , out of the reach of the barbed branches already plummeting toward her .
as he threw her , a branch caught damon through his chest , pinning him to the ground .
the branch had stopped his heart and the tree 's poison was spreading through his veins and arteries .
once again , he saw damon 's long , graceful leap toward bonnie that had ended with damon fal ing to earth , a wooden branch driven through his heart .
damon 's claws clenched the branch he sat on .
the snapping of branches was deafening , as if something huge was shoving its way through the bracken .
al around them , thorny rosebush branches whipped back and forth , although there was no wind .
she yelped as one of the waving branches smacked her across the arm , gashing her skin open .
the space between the bushes was barely wide enough for three to run abreast , and a thorny branch caught in elena 's hair .
was this an olive branch - from her ?
she blinked open her eyes , squinting against the afternoon sun streaming in through branches .
she could hear the propeller churning , could smell the engine smoking , and yet the branches overhead were n't moving .
past the driveway , tree branches thrashed and creaked .
this happened more often than it should have : afternoon thunderstorms threw tree branches into the transformers , and entire neighborhoods lost power for several hours .
the screen lit up with a black - and - white photograph of ivy in profile , looking thoughtful , the outline of tree branches against a sunset sky behind her .
olivia crept up to her sister 's house early sunday morning , the shadows of willow branches reaching out at her eerily .
alexander walked , his hands in his pockets , kicking the leafy branches with his boots .
the woods were full of noise that morning , from the cracking of branches under our feet to the birds singing , but mom did n't say anything and i did n't ask any questions .
to anyone walking by - not that many people ever just ` ` walked by '' in these woods - the portal would n't have looked like anything but a small opening in a bunch of branches .
mom held out her hand to me , and i took it , ducking under the branches and stepping into the itineris .
he cut off a branch of leaves and slipped it under his shirt .
rajiv pulled out the branch from under his shirt and handed it to abigail .
he twirled the branch of demon herb between his thumb and forefinger .
when she looked back again , the ancient was gone , nothing but the sway of a few low - hanging branches at the edge of the forest to tell which direction he 'd fled .
the branches are bare and the air is laced with rain .
there are snowmen decorating the yards , ice glazing the rain gutters and branches , and the roofs of the houses are piled with snow .
` ` alex , '' i hiss and chase after him , keeping my head low to the ground because the branches of the trees clip my head .
the ground is slippery and snow keeps falling from the branches of the trees and down the collar of my coat .
i shout and the sound echoes for miles and snow shivers from the bare branches of the trees .
the shadows of the branches cast across his face and the wind howls around us .
it seems like everything is moving in slow motion and i ' m linked to each aspect that surrounds me ; the expanding of the icicles as the temperature descends , the sounds of branches snapping , the inhale and exhale of alex 's breath .
a branch snags my cheek and splits open my skin .
his green eyes glisten in the sunlight that is flickering through the branches of the trees .
autumn leaves fall from the branches and shower down over our heads .
* * * a little girl laughs as she runs around a tree and her fingers snag at the leaves on the low branches .
night and the cold surround me as i swing my arms and battle the branches , fighting my way deeper into the trees .
every shadow moves and branches snap from all direction .
i hike for what seems like forever , stumbling over fallen tree trunks and fighting against the unruly , blooming branches .
raindrops pour down on top of us , soaking our skin and clothes at the same time that it pitter - patters against the canopy of leaves and branches above our heads .
another shriek shakes the trees and ground around us , causing leaves to break from the branches .
she pointed to a mound of logs and branches .
it was made of branches and bones lashed together with cords .
a boy with red hair came running up with a forked branch .
he was talking to the redhead with the forked branch .
peering cautiously through the branches , he eyed the lot next door .
it had been dark when he 'd arrived last night , and teddy had marveled at how beautiful it all was as his headlights slid over the ice - encased branches of the trees and the deep snow on either side of the cleared driveway .
silence immediately surrounded him and then he became aware of his breathing , hers , the soft sounds of small creatures moving through the snowy woods , the soft thud of snow sliding off a branch or something else nearby and hitting the snow - covered ground .
inside , i found dragon 's blood resin , a small bottle of gardenia oil , branches of juniper berries , and a glittering smoky quartz crystal , rutilated with lines of gold .
just start on that big limb there , swing over there , and then use those branches for handholds . ''
` ` i ' m hungry , '' livy announced suddenly and jeanne louise glanced her way to see her staring up at the tree branches above them .
` ` go find some long branches to use to cook them then , and gather firewood , '' paul said , not opening his eyes .
paul leaned forward and kissed her forehead , then got up to follow his daughter and help gather wood for a fire and branches to cook the weenies on .
my boots hit the sidewalk and the dappled pattern of sun that made it through the colored leaves still clinging to the dark branches .
an old oak tree thicker than i could get my arms around dominated the backyard , multiple swaths of fabric draped over the lower branches to make a fluttering shelter of sorts .
focus blurry , i stared at the canopy of bare branches above me to the pale blue of an autumn morning .
it was the only noise apart from the wind in the dry - leafed branches and the cheerful shrieks of his children at play .
a branch in the nearby trees waved wildly , and a black something hit the earth .
he held the branch away from himself dramatical y , arm extended , like it was a sword and he was about to impale himself .
halfway up the side of the nearest mountain , i made my perch in the top branches of a big spruce that cleared its neighbors by several meters .
i fol owed through the branches , most of them so close - packed that i only rarely had to real y leap from one tree to another .
i moved higher in the branches , looking for a tree with a good view .
then he made an enormous leap - i wondered if i could have jumped that high , even as young and strong as i was - and caught a branch about halfway up the closest tree .
i sprinted through the branches in a direct line back to the house .
thomas stroked her hair , then picked up one of the broken branches .
it took a cursed few precious seconds to pick up on the strained tone of his voice , the delicate way he 'd picked up the branch , as if it were made of glass and he was afraid his grip would break it .
imagined him picking it up and slicing off the end of that branch to a pointed angle with one cut , as if he 'd been born a samurai .
thomas was already driving the branch of thorns with its sharpened end toward his back .
he was even insane enough to dart a quick look around for the sharpened branch , though his face fell when he saw it had rolled under the bed behind rex .
about twenty - five - feet in diameter , it was surrounded by an interlocking circle of live oaks , pines and maples , their branches a tapestry against the night sky .
leaves and branches making contact as the breeze moved through them .
those bare feet pressing precisely into the earth , disturbing no undergrowth , her body flowing through it , letting the foliage pass across her bare skin , branches leaving tiny red scrapes that would vanish in a blink ?
the branches of the large live oak across from him stretched out like the gnarled arms of a giant .
yes , that was a tail wrapped around the branch several times , helping her remain still .
she exploded from the branch , swooping down .
the wind kicked up , making the branches of the live oaks creak , the pines whisper secrets .
she caught sight of something dark in the branches of the old quince tree in front of the house .
he glanced back , once , and saw that the crow had left the branches and dropped down on the rabbit .
yangtze had escaped and was dashing through the front yard up to the single birch tree , where he yapped shrilly up into the branches , rolls of fat on his back jiggling .
outside she could see the field and the tossing branches of the oak trees beyond , and once again she was overcome with that strange feeling of foreboding .
the voice came from overhead , and when stefan looked up he saw damon perching among the spreading branches of the oak tree .
the pristine grass lawns were drenched and several branches and leaves were scattered in the asphalt driveways .
i pushed past a barren branch - november 's chill had robbed nearly every tree of its leaves - and sniffed the air .
in the close confines of the branches , there was nothing to distract me from the sweet scent of the girl 's blood .
northern trees were round , quaint , elliptical maples where our lush oaks spread out , soaking up the sun to the farthest tips of their branches .
` ` just a bit of jam , '' she said lightly , wiping her finger on the low - hanging branch of a passing tree .
vases in every gothic arched nook and cranny held elegant arrangements of grasses and blooming branches of quince , enhancing the woodland effect .
i swore under my breath , watching him disappear into the branches below .
there were lights , too , strung through the tree branches and shining on flowers and bushes and walking paths .
a stag , because it was making the most noise , clashing its antlers against tree branches , challenging other males .
once outside it glided across the maple branches with taunting ease and leaped down into the snow , disappearing .
we spent the morning digging a deep pit with our hands and the rough tools we 'd fashioned from branches and bones .
when the pit was done , we harvested a couple of dozen thick branches and sharpened the tips , creating stakes that we were going to place in the base of the pit .
funny , when all the others on the same branch were red .
before he disengaged the driveway gate , he sprang onto one of the retaining walls , gaining a view through the screening of the crepe myrtle branches .
he played a flute to help her sleep , rocking her on his thighs , letting her hold on to his hair and sway , as if in the cradle of a solid oak 's branches .
she sat on his bike in the driveway , under the spreading branches of a live oak dripping with spanish moss .
i stood under the branches and he shook them .
the tail curled once around the branch , the excess flicking slowly from side to side .
and found him wait- ing for her there , crouched just below the branch she was on .
a tranquility fi lled her that she 'd never had before , a sense of completion so absolute there were times she just sat in the sun on a branch outside the caves and did nothing but absorb the treasures of sun and wind , the aromas of earth and the nearby creek waters , anticipating the evening with jacob .
` ` it was plucked from the branches of his bush before the desert was allowed to turn him to dust .
he stumbled forward , one boot snagging on a branch .
the ground curved down , leading toward a lonely clump of trees - kait could see their upper branches against the lighter black of the night sky .
the alder branches were mostly bare , but there were a few reddish leaves hanging on each twig , which gave the stand an overall reddish cast .
through the windshield she could see trees , their branches dripping with green moss .
it was a disturbing sight , all those branches that were n't white or brown , but lumpy unnatural green .
kaitlyn turned away , to find anna staring fixedly at something on a branch .
it went straight up , into the canopy of branches - and disappeared .
the jay was fluttering on a branch , scolding them .
and here the trees were so big their branches made a roof over your head .
but the moon had been high , shining its full white light here and there 1 through the oak branches .
then a wind rises , gently , moving the branches of the olive trees .
a great mesh of branches rose between him and the wet shining sky .
and down there , through the branches , against a velvet blackness , he saw the great burning arc of the golden gate bridge .
ah , but to take one tiny detail - the damp rooftops spilling downhill away from him , or the gnarled branches rising in front of him .
he stopped beside the painted wall of a garden , reaching up to rest his hand on a gnarled branch , letting the cool fleecy green leaves touch his face .
it flashed yellow and then white as it traveled down her backbone and then spread out as if into a million branches in her limbs .
and the other three walls , so dark , seemingly covered by a fine black wire mesh , until you realized what you were seeing : an endless ink - drawn vine , crowding every inch between floor and ceiling , growing from a single root in one corner into a million tiny swarming branches , each branch surrounded by countless carefully inscribed names .
she looked at the myriad tiny names inscribed in black ink ; she stood back and followed the progress of one branch , one thin delicate branch , as it rose slowly to the ceiling through a hundred different forks and twists .
she looked at the myriad tiny names inscribed in black ink ; she stood back and followed the progress of one branch , one thin delicate branch , as it rose slowly to the ceiling through a hundred different forks and twists .
and while that may be good news for some genuine , vicious , tough old felons with homemade tattoos and biceps like tree branches , it is not going to be good news for you . ''
elena felt as if she had been doing nothing in al her life except walk under a shady canopy of high branches .
rather than sky , there was nothing but tangled tree branches , clearly heavy and so intricately entwined as to take up every bit of space above .
it was a long jump , but it had n't taken her anywhere near the canopy of woven branches above .
it was the same as what he 'd had his puppet , damon , do when he 'd held elena and matt hostage before - except that he did n't need a pine branch to direct the pain .
still , surely just beyond that low branch was ... then meredith saw something that was not smoke or fire .
damon had stopped and was kneeling behind an enormous broken tree branch .
she 'd feared - among other things - that it might be up too high to climb , that it might be so entangled with roots or branches that today , certainly after hundreds or even thousands of years , it would be impossible to chop out .
` ` things are heating up in what 's left of poor old fel 's church , '' said damon , who was staring intently upward at the branches above him .
and bonnie was scrambling as lightly as she had boasted , up on top of the dead tree branch that sheltered them .
when her vision adjusted , she saw that they were long , curved black branches , spaced evenly around the tree like thirty spider legs , thirty long spears that were meant to either imprison someone inside them like the bars of a cel , or to - pin them into the strange sand beneath her feet .
even as she was staring at the sharp recurved barbs on the branches , meant to keep anything caught by them held permanently in the ground , she was thinking of damon 's annoyance if a shaft had pierced his leather jacket .
the branch , which was proper javelin size , had gone through damon 's shoulder , which must hurt like hel , in addition to having splattered a blood drop right at the corner of his mouth .
` ` come on , hurry , give me your axe , '' she said , so desperately , and with such an air of knowledge that stefan handed it over wordlessly , and obeyed when she told him to steady the curving spider - leg branch from above and below .
then with a few quick strokes of the axe she cut through the black branch that was thick enough in circumference that she could n't have clasped her fingers around it .
when she was finished , she had a loose spider - leg branch that drooped back to the tree , anchored to nothing - and something that looked more like a proper stake in damon .
the tree had slammed down another spider 's leg set of branches , trapping them and damon 's body between two circles of wooden bars .
a rootlet had curled around it and was swiftly dragging it into the upper branches .
these wooden branches would come crashing down again and again , as often as the tree felt necessary , until stefan 's crushed bones joined the others that had been mil ed to fine sand .
` ` stefan , bonnie - do n't touch the branches , '' she gasped .
` ` make sure you 're not touching any part of the branches . ''
with a scream that peeled raw and bleeding from her backbone and came hoarsely out of her throat , elena grabbed a branch of the tree that had kil ed damon , that had murdered her beloved , and that would murder her and these two others she loved as well .
something in elena 's mind noted that very far away the same destruction was going on , racing to turn branches and leaves into infinitesimal bits of matter that hung in the air like haze .
like her name spoken by whispering branches or the whirring of passing bicycle wheels .
damon salvatore was lounging in midair , nominally supported by one branch of a ... who knew the names of trees anyway ?
he thought lazily , fluttering as he transformed from a sleek crow back into a drop - dead gorgeous young man lounging in a high branch of the tree .
it ought to have knocked something dead nearby - from the roof , from the air , from a branch ... maybe even from next door .
but although damon could feel clouds darkening above him in response to his mood , and the wind rubbing branches together outside , there was no falling body , no attempt at dying retaliation .
thrusting straight through the open window - like a knobby , shaggy green spear or the grasping arm of some savage earthen giant - was the branch of a tree .
it just cleared the base of meredith 's arched neck , and its lower branches passed over bonnie 's small body .
he could even smell the places where smaller branches had broken off and were oozing sap .
matt glanced at her , startled , and scratched his cheek against the splintered end of the big branch .
the freshly splintered ends of the smaller branch had moved only infinitesimally , but there was a curve to them now , and the splinters were pressing into meredith 's throat .
` ` there 's a flashlight in the glove compartment ... . '' ` ` the glove compartment is completely blocked by branches .
to matt it looked as if the shaggy , aromatic evergreen branches were engulfing her .
it 's little branches .
he took as much of a deep breath as he could , pushed back on the branch , hearing a cry from meredith , andtwisted , feeling jagged splinters like thin wooden knives tear his throat and ear and scalp .
his lap was filled with branches ; evergreen needles were thickly piled everywhere .
she was almost buried in branches , one hand wrestling with something at her throat , but she saw him .
matt dug and tore into the branches , then groped for the handle that would collapse the backrest of his seat .
he ducked under the huge arm - branch - if it still deserved the name , since the car was full of similar huge branches now .
he ducked under the huge arm - branch - if it still deserved the name , since the car was full of similar huge branches now .
many tiny branches were still entwining her , caught in the fabric of her shirt , wound into her hair .
where the branches let go , they left welts or tiny puncture wounds .
` ` it 's almost as if they were trying to grow into her , '' matt said , as a long , thin branch pulled away , leaving bloody pinpricks behind .
it whistled , as if through many branches .
he stared hungrily through branches , trying to make out the accelerator , the ignition .
` ` that branch would ' ve taken your head off ! ''
` ` meredith - the branches are filling up the front seat .
the three of them were being pushed together now , as branches pressed the seats back onto them .
please , please , please help ... '' for five , ten , fifteen minutes she kept it up , as the branches grew , enclosing them with their sweet , resinous scent .
damon expanded his senses to their widest reach , waiting to hear or feel something shattering , combusting - something falling blind , with its own blood tumbling nearby , from a branch , from the air , fromsomewhere .
somehow they ended up in the old wood , where skeletons of trees mixed with the living branches .
then , just as he had been reclining on a branch , wishing that mutt , at least , had sustained some sort of painful and lasting injury , they had appeared .
there was someone else there , sitting calmly right beside him on the big branch .
the shock of it had sent him tumbling off the branch - without turning on his vampire ability to float .
shinichi seemed to deliberately relax back against his branch .
he wondered , as he squatted on the branch .
` ` it always pays to look up , little brother , '' advised a charming voice above him , and then damon , who had been clinging to the tree like a lizard , did a forward flip and landed on stefan 's branch .
and then with very little fuss , and certainly no power at all that stefan could discern , something landed in the tree above them and dropped down to their branch , changing as it did .
` ` three 's a crowd , especially on this branch . ''
something was stirring the tree 's upper branches , something more than wind .
he had to make it out of there ; the branches were stirring again and he did n't want to wait to see whether it was wind .
and then there was the crunch of leaves and branches under the car , and for a moment all movement stopped , but matt kept his foot pressed as hard as he could on the accelerator , and suddenly he was free , and being thrown around as the car careened in the ditch .
he bent down , every movement as unconsciously and economically graceful as a panther 's , and picked up a small broken branch of what looked like ordinary virginia pine .
it looked more like a fan than a branch .
meredith was dropping a thick branch she had been holding like a baseball bat .
it was like the sound the branch had made - a sharp crack plus a bursting , only much louder , and repeated many times over , like popcorn popping .
damon was walking back and forth , with the virginia pine branch in his right hand , tapping it on his left palm .
damon picked up his branch again and again waved the end of it like a japanese fan .
then he picked up his damned pine branch .
very slowly , damon lowered the pine branch .
then he waggled the pine branch .
she tumbled over and over in the air , floating , remaining about two feet off the ground , reaching out to grab fronds , branches of bushes , anything she could use to slow her velocity .
with perfect timing there was the crackle of a branch behind them .
behind her , stepping on branches and letting loose the occasional grunt or curse , were two other figures , one tall and thin but bulbous on top , and one shorter and stouter .
then , carefully , she inched her way closer to the trunk , pausing only to move to a higher twig a caterpillar that was sharing the branch with her .
it was far too high a branch for her personal taste .
their skin was similar to the chitin - like skin of the insects , but much bumpier , with knotholes and burls and all the outward aspects of bark on their branches .
the way their limbs were twisted ; the way they walked , shambling forward like apes , the way their bodies ended on top with treelike caricatures of human faces , surmounted by a tangle of thinner branches sticking out at odd angles - they were calculated to look like creatures of nightmare .
like something out of a nursery - tale nightmare , it was a tree and then - suddenly - it was athing , a treelike giant that suddenly moved swiftly toward them , its upper branches bunching together to become long arms , and then everyone was screaming and trying to get away from it .
any of them that tried to resist the trees were slapped and cuffed by hard and sharp - thorned branches , and then , with a lithe branch wound around the neck , weredragged .
any of them that tried to resist the trees were slapped and cuffed by hard and sharp - thorned branches , and then , with a lithe branch wound around the neck , weredragged .
but the hideous creatures were actually overtopping the house now , and their upper , snake - like branches slashed into her legs while misao lashed out with her whip .
misao promptly escaped , and burrowed into the christmas - tree - like branches .
` ` bad ... trees ... go ... to ... hell , '' elena cried , throwing her entire body weight into digging the shears she held into the base of the branch that had tried to crush her .
because misao seemed finally to have chosen the slow but sure method of descent - to have branch after branch take hold of her fox body and pass it down to the next .
because misao seemed finally to have chosen the slow but sure method of descent - to have branch after branch take hold of her fox body and pass it down to the next .
and tree branches leaned in from all sides to pin him and damon into their own little world , a lattice to keep them contained .
now there was a sword in his hand , undoubtedly conjured up by the magical housekey , and the sword slashed through the branches even as the branches reached out to trap him .
now there was a sword in his hand , undoubtedly conjured up by the magical housekey , and the sword slashed through the branches even as the branches reached out to trap him .
and then his sword was flashing in an arc , sweeping all around bonnie , and the tough , fingerlike tips of the branches that held her were cut cleanly away .
six tree - men came to life around her and plunged at her , with greedy , grasping finger branches .
the sky over the car darkened further in response , and wind ripped summer leaves from branches before their time .
she put down on a table beside her an object made of smooth pale maple that looked like a very short t or , if held on its side , like a gracefully waving tree with one short horizontal branch .
` ` oh , my , matt , when that big branch came down i thought your arm would be broken - at least .
lady ulma had then nodded at the window , out of which a small mill stream could be seen , and some plum trees , with ripe fruit blazing like jewels on the branches , and then with a sweep of her hand indicated the gardens , orchards , fields , and forests on the estate .
she was sitting on a fal en tree branch opposite me , nervously biting her fingernails .
on the branch of a maple tree overhanging the path , a large crow stretched out its glossy blue - black wings .
damon shifted his talons along the branch , then smoothed an errant feather with his beak .
but now a stocky , dark - haired man was coming out of the science lab , and damon straightened on his branch .
then , efficiently and viciously , he snatched a tree branch from the ground beside them and , in one smooth , quick movement , jammed it through nick 's chest .
nick screamed , an agonized wail of pain , and lurched away , clawing at the branch .
behind jack , nick strained to pull the branch from his chest , giving a painful - sounding groan as it slowly slid out .
he sighed and leaned back against a birch tree , looking up through branches at the stars , so clear and distant .
on the tree branch above , a magnolia blossom slowly began to fill with light .
oak leaves swirled among the rows of granite headstones , and the trees lashed their branches together in frenzy .
the wind was picking up again , the branches tossing .
but the night was clear and strangely calm , and no breeze stirred the dry brown leaves left on the branches .
the underbrush was thick , and dead branches reached out to snatch at them .
once there was a tiny gap between stone and well , matt used a dead branch to lever the opening wider .
outside on the skeletal branches of the quince tree was a crow .
outside , the quince branches squeaked against the glass , but nothing else moved until dawn .
it moaned through the branches of the oak trees , tearing off the remaining leaves and sending them down in showers .
the tree was a mass of heaving , pitching branches , its trunk blocking the way back to town completely .
of course it was too big to move , bonnie thought , already scrambling through the branches .
this is a great place for walking in the evening ; you can hear the birds sing as you will never hear them in the vieux carre ; and the twilight lasts forever over the roofs of the warehouses along the ever - curving river , shining through the great heavy branches of the trees .
the sky in the tops of the windows was perfectly blue , vibrantly blue , and the sunlight was pouring in on the polished floor , and all the world appeared glorious in the brightness- the bare tree branches with their white trimming of snow , and the snow - covered roof opposite , and the room itself , full of whiteness and lustrous color , light glancing off the mirror , and the crystal glass on the dresser , off the brass knob of the bathroom door .
birds with feathers the color of the summer sky or the burning sun streak through the wet branches .
so tender the wet waxen flowers growing in the higher more verdant branches , slumbering in the promise of the morning light .
i saw the giant traveler 's palm with its branches seemingly braided as they came out of the stalk !
i did n't go there until i 'd been in the gardens up the mountain , and had stood on those very cliffs he had visited , looking out over the forested mountains , and listening to the wind in the branches of the noisy clacking coconut palms .
at last i sat down , against the trunk of a great dark tree with branches spreading over me in an airy canopy , and i rested my arm on my knee and my head on my arm .
there , to the right , something was rattling branches together .
only the wind seemed impervious to the surrounding menace , swishing leaves and clicking branches together .
right now she was strewn atop a thick branch , legs swinging over the side , handmade spear clutched tightly in her palms .
she lost her breath , barely managing to remain on the branch .
he perched at the end of the branch , his gaze tracing her tattoos with ... longing ?
layel soared through the trees , dewy branches slapping him in the face .
the second amazon woman - nola , he recalled - balanced on a branch , facing him and grinning .
right now he hovered in a tree , concealed by branches and thick green foliage , looking down at delilah 's team .
except for zane , who sat behind them , sharpening a branch with his claws just as layel had done .
a naked branch slapped her cheek , and she reached up to rub the fresh wound .
their branches slapped in front of her , blocking the dragon from view .
she pushed the snow - white branch of a ghost tree from her path , taking a small bit of satisfaction when it slapped shivawn in the cheek and he grunted .
a jagged branch suddenly sailed into brand 's shoulder , knocking him down .
she bent down , grabbed another branch and launched it at him .
the warrior screamed , the sound echoing from branches , causing a flock of birds to take flight .
darkness was thicker than a blanket as he strode forward , pushing through the trees , not noticing as the branches slapped and cut him .
there were indeed some long thin pine saplings lying near by , stripped of all branches .
she shoved me up close to it , grabbed a burning branch , and ran it over the flesh of my legs and arms .
i knew she would n't say these things unless they were true , so i stood still and ground my teeth together while she ran the glowing tip of the branch over my flesh .
during a break , i studied my flesh where arra had run the flaming branch over it .
` ` killer sweater , '' the librarian said to sophia , whose top was embroidered with the branches of a bare , crow - filled tree .
sure enough , olivia could see that her father was n't grabbing monster fur at all - he was holding the branches of an enormous tree .
out of the corner of her eye , she could see him down below , placing the last candles amid the branches .
the orchard sat there frozen , the jagged branches jutting up into the cloudy sky like bony fingers .
the branches gave way without shattering , concealing the small child .
looking between the branches in the frozen thickets , his ungloved hands pushed through thorns , bending back the branches .
looking between the branches in the frozen thickets , his ungloved hands pushed through thorns , bending back the branches .
the branches flew back into place , concealing kahli .
she ripped an icicle off a low branch .
it was n't very big , but she needed to move higher to get to the thinner branches .
not thinking about it , kahli shimmied out from the trunk , hugging the branch above her as her feet crept out onto the limb .
sliding out farther onto the icy branch , kahli wished she had nails on the soles of her boots .
kahli shouted down to them without looking , ` ` i ' m gon na snap off the end of the branch and toss it to you .
` ` yeah , well since they did n't specify , they 're getting a branch .
bending back the end of the branch , kahli snapped off the tip .
satisfied that the branch would suffice , kahli said , ` ` heads up , '' and tossed it down .
reaching out with one hand , she grabbed the branch , hung for half a second , and then dropped to the ground .
kahli reached into the bag and pulled out the willow branch and thrust it under his nose , ` ` this is willow bark . ''
` ` that is a willow branch , my dear .
kahli took the tiny branch and stuck it in her mouth .
` ` i ca n't see , '' trevor said , removing a branch from his hair .
the wind blew stronger , tossing the trees and littering the path with small branches and pinecones .
his vision sparkled with stars so badly , he stumbled over a fallen branch and bumped against a tree trunk .
he ran toward her , shoving branches out of the way .

a huge tree branch swayed and then broke free from the tree , landing between the two .
i stared at the branch .

there 's this big tree between the church and the school , so big its lower branches touch the roofs of both , and on the roof of the church is a sharp steeple with a bell hanging in it , and on the roof of the school is a porchlike thing with a railing around it that 's painted white , too .
she strides off alone back to the school , head high , whipping her riding crop at bushes and leafy branches and anything else she passes .
i duck down so he do n't see my silhouette against the bright moonlit sky and i watch him through the branches of the big tree that stands between the church and the school , touching the roofs of both .

we go slowly , though , and i hear twigs snapping and the rustle of tree branches , and i know that alex is feeling his way , trying to clear a path for us .
then i hear him rustling in the branches all around us , muttering little curses under his breath , a monologue i do n't quite follow .
the branches above us form a canopy that reminds me of the vaulted ceiling of st . paul 's cathedral , where i used to sit in sunday school to hear lectures about atoms and probabilities and god 's order .
the leaves rustle and shake all around us , a constantly shifting pattern of greens and blacks , set dancing as countless unseen things hurry and skip from branch to branch .

alex walks more surely now , occasionally sweeping a branch out of the way so i can pass underneath it , or swatting at the branches blocking our way , but we 're not following any path that i can see , and after fifteen minutes i begin to fear that we 're just turning in circles , or going deeper and deeper into the woods without any real destination .

soon we come to an area of enormous trees , bare branches gray and gnarled like arthritic fingers .
high in the branches of the trees are massive tangles of birds ' nests : curls and spray , bits of moss and hanging creepers , all woven together so that it looks as though the trees are crowned with hair .

one branch extends almost all the way to the wall .
the branch begins to sink under my weight .
as the branch sinks , the distance between my position and the top of the wall increases ; any farther , and i 'll have no chance of making it over .

i spring up and toward the wall and the branch moves with me , like a springboard , as my weight is released .
i plunge into the tangle of growth to my right , pushing toward the sound , swiping with my flashlight to help clear the interlaced path of creepers and pine branches .

` ` it ... the branch ... it tried to trip me , did n't it ? ''
` ` if he 's gone off and left us- '' a branch rustled somewhere in the woods behind us .
` ` that sounded a little too big for a cat ... '' another branch snapped , closer this time .
we ran , weaving around trees , tearing through bramble and undergrowth , hearing the crashing of twigs and branches at our heels as it followed .
` ` kenzie , '' i panted , trying to track the thing 's head through the branches .
gasping , i dropped to my knees as it writhed and thrashed , scraping the side of its face against the trunk , snapping branches and smashing into the trees .
` ` lindwurm , '' came a voice above our heads , and grimalkin appeared in the branches , peering down at us .
a tiny faery with a mushroom cap peeked at us from a nearby branch , but she did n't even glance at it a second time .
kenzie gasped as neon lights erupted along the branches , like christmas bulbs or those fiberglass trees in department stores .
there were no wires or extension cords ; the bulbs were growing right out of the branches .
around us , the trees glimmered silver ; trunks , leaves , branches and twigs shining as if they were made of polished metal .
the fireflies continued to light up the forest as we walked on , blinking through leaves and branches , glinting off the trunks .
banners emblazoned with the great iron tree flapped in the wind , and the path to the front gate was lined with enormous oaks , forming a tunnel of branches , leaves and lights .
past the gates , the road circled a massive green lawn strewn with metal trees , their leaves and branches glittering like tinsel as the light caught them .
two figures circled each other beneath the branches of a silver pine , a pair of swords held in front of them .
the hallway of trees , for one , with glowing bulbs lighting the way through metal branches .
keirran 's glider dropped down so that it was nearly brushing the tops of the branches .
hoping kenzie and i would n't fly headfirst into the branches , i followed , passing through the canopy into an open clearing .
i could just make out the bright gleam of keirran 's hair through the shadows , and spiraled down , dodging branches , until my feet lightly touched the forest floor .
grateful for the interruption , i hurried to where the faery waited for us beneath the branches of a large pine by the side of the road .
lights flickered through the branches .
we followed , trailing him under branches , through knee - high grass and across an empty , weed - choked parking lot .
an enormous tree loomed up from the center , extending gnarled branches skyward , which was easy because the room had no ceiling .
` ` leanansidhe wants the ceremony done tonight , '' annwyl was saying , raising an arm to touch a low - hanging branch .
snapping a twig from the nearest branch , she knelt in front of keirran and held up the stick .
annwyl flicked the branch with her fingers , and it snapped , one half of the stick spinning away into the flowers .
strands of moonlight slanted in through the branches overhead , dappling the ground inside the circle , and even i could feel that this was a place of old , powerful magic .
keirran lifted his arm to let razor scurry to an overhead branch .
a breeze hissed through the clearing , rattling the branches and making the grass sway .
from the edge of the woods , high in the branches above the swirling fey , a pair of familiar golden eyes gleamed in the darkness , watching us .
` ` so nice to see you , human , '' a voice purred from an overhead branch .
he yawned again and stretched on the branch , arching his tail over his back , making us wait .
` ` so , if we are done asking useless questions ... '' grimalkin hopped to a lower branch , waving his tail and watching us with amusement .
everything seemed quiet and peaceful , with the sun setting in the west and the birds still chirping in the branches .
` ` this , '' she said , gazing up at the branches , ` ` is shakespeare 's garden .
the branch shuddered , and the leaf uncurled , green and alive again .
it was empty , except for a lone black bird near the top branches , preening its feathers .
a huge oak tree , its hanging branches draped in moss , loomed out of the fog , and we stopped beneath the ragged curtains .
i saw kenzie looking for them , scanning the trees and branches and the dark shadows of the yard for invisible fey , but she was disappointed .
annwyl leaned a shoulder against the tree , where strands of bright green ivy were slowly creeping up toward the branches , rustling softly as they coiled around the trunk .
` ` the full moon is tonight , '' i went on as annwyl absently brushed a dead branch .
but we 'd reached the center of a cluster of huge oak trees , swathes of spanish moss dangling from the branches like lace , and i could suddenly feel eyes on me .
a sudden wind rattled the branches of the oaks , making the dryads jerk their heads up .
the space between the oaks and the faint light filtering through the branches dimmed rapidly , plunging the grove into shadow .
i yelped as one shadow - thing bounded toward me , swiping at it with the branch .
ancient oak branches swept down , sweeping away dark creatures like a broom , flinging them back .
i snarled and hit at them with the branch , but they either slithered aside or accepted the blows , making no sound as they piled on the oracle again .
twigs , string , grass stalks and branches were woven into each other , surrounding the hunched form in the middle of the nest .
we eased up to the tangle of sticks and branches , where one of the crows cawed and aimed a sharp peck at the side of my face , making me flinch .
trees surrounded us , branches dangling close together , lacy curtains of moss waving in the breeze .
the wind tossing the branches died .
the stab wound looked pretty deep , but the prince had n't seemed to notice until annwyl forcibly sat him down , ordered razor onto a tree branch and pulled up his sleeve .
razor buzzed worriedly and peered down from the branch .
except for razor , chattering at keirran from the branch .
amazingly , our hike through the wyldwood was uneventful ; except for a will - o'-the - wisp and a curious wood sprite that kept appearing in the branches overhead , i did n't see any fey .
` ` i ' m glad you 're feeling better , '' he said to kenzie , holding a branch that had several tiny berries hanging among the leaves .
they glittered like strange green jewels as he sat down , raising the branch like a peace offering .
the branches were bent under the weight , and the grass around the trunk was scattered with red , bulbous fruit .
he was right ; the apples hung full and untouched on the branches or rotting on the ground .
they were all massive , ancient things , with thick trunks and gnarled branches overly full of bright red fruit .
except that the orchard was so very quiet that the sound of a bird 's call in the absolute stillness made me jerk my head up , searching the branches .
a dark shadow swooped overhead and alighted on a branch , making my stomach jump .
when i looked back , a figure stood on the branch with his arms crossed , smirking down at us .
he straightened on the branch , briskly rubbing his hands together .
puck shrugged and walked along the branch , balanced perfectly on the slender limb .
puck jerked , catching himself on the branch as a single apple fell from a cluster above him , bounced off his head and dropped with a thump to the grass .
with a creaking and groaning of massive limbs , the creature stood up , towering forty feet in the air : a tangled giant of roots , moss and tree branches , its arms dangling past its stumpy legs to brush the ground .
puck groaned and leaped from the branch , pulling two daggers as he landed beside us .
we sidled around the trunk , watching as the creature moved between the tree aisles , crouching and peering over the branches as it searched for us .
a massive foot smashed down a few yards from the trunk , and the tree rustled and hissed , dropping apples everywhere , as the giant parted the branches overhead and spotted us .
but at that moment , a screaming flock of ravens erupted from the branches , flying in the giant 's face .
i could barely see her through the cage of branches now , and desperation flared up to suffocate me .
once the door was shut and we were a good distance away , no longer able to hear the furious bellows still echoing through the branches , the cat paused and turned to face us .
` ` razor , wait here , '' keirran said , putting the gremlin on a branch .
said a voice behind us , and puck poked his head out from behind a cluster of branches .
leafless trees grew close together , the sunlight peeking through their branches to dapple the snow , and every tree , trunk , twig and branch was coated in ice .
leafless trees grew close together , the sunlight peeking through their branches to dapple the snow , and every tree , trunk , twig and branch was coated in ice .
another stag , its antlers entangled in the branches of a low tree , now immobilized for all time .
raising my swords , i faced the next three swooping down from the branches of the trees .
the ice that had coated every leaf , tree , twig and branch was nearly gone , and the snow was melting away , showing patches of bare earth beneath .
water dripped from the branches overhead , turning the ground slushy , and mud sucked at our feet as we walked .
an explosion of ice , wind and leaves erupted around keirran , rattling branches and causing everyone to flinch back .
kenzie gasped as the prince vanished into the crushing branches , but there was a burst of cold , and the roots turned to ice .
it roared and smashed into the barrier , snapping twigs and branches , trying to push through .
the things on the other side of the bramble wall roared and shook the branches , nearly through .
except for the moon and stars through the branches , there was no light and barely any sound .
` ` my story was i got hit by a tree branch . ''
i kick a branch .
caleb picks up a branch , breaking pieces off and throwing them .
as i get up to leave , a branch crunches behind me .
a branch , maybe ?
i won , right before the branch i was on snapped and i fell to the ground .
i look up , trying to locate that broken branch .
besides , if i jump hard enough and high enough , i just might be able to catch a branch on the tree a few feet away from the window .
caleb looks up at the thick branches and green leaves waving at us from above .
figures of ghosts hang just over us from the low branches , and off the drive grimacing zombies lean against various trees .
i stop to listen and hear nothing but the wind blowing through the branches and sam 's heavy breathing .
in the backyard the trees stand sentinel around us , frozen branches like figurines of hollow glass , an inch of a fine white powder piled atop each one .
i focus on the large branch coming off the tree 's trunk and i try to break that branch away but it wo n't come .
i focus on the large branch coming off the tree 's trunk and i try to break that branch away but it wo n't come .
i grit my teeth and furrow my brows and finally a loud snap rings through the air like a shotgun blast and the branch comes sailing towards me .
we walk hand in hand beneath an umbrella of white from the snow piled atop the tree branches overhead .
there are no sounds save the birds and the occasional pack of snow falling from the nearby branches .
` ` i cut it on a branch in the woods . ''
the beast at the school lets out another roar , and i reach for the low branches of a nearby tree and pull myself up .
i land with a thud , branches and mud falling atop me .
we exit the woods , leaving behind us the overhanging branches and bushes and the smell of wet and rotting leaves .
we stop and huddle beneath the low branches of a tall tree .
there 's a small tree branch with the bark pared away , and under that there is an odd circular device with a glass lens and floating needle not unlike a compass .
i carefully set it back inside the chest and pick up the short tree branch .
with a deep breath , i stick the branch out one of the two windows and i concentrate on the opposite end .
bernie kosar transforms into a small brown owl , and he flaps his way onto a low branch of the maple tree .
after a half mile , i ' m veering into the forest , loving the way the branches break off my chest and arms , how the tall patches of grass whip my jeans .
i look over my shoulder often , and sam is never farther than forty yards behind me , jumping over logs , sliding under branches .
i slowly set the branch back into the chest and close the lid .
after passing king 's throne , which is a tall slender rock that looks like a high - back chair , i immediately spot two tall trees leaning against one another at slight angles , their branches appearing like arms wrapped around each other in an embrace .
the pines rustle again , and one of the lower branches moves .
i ' m carrying the small tree branch from my chest .
i aim and concentrate on what i want from the trees , and soon i hear the creaking of their roots and the clattering of their branches .
at one point , to break up the boredom of the hike , i tickle six 's face by lowering a branch right in front her .
with the small branch in my hand , i bend a large tree over to create shade on the boulders .
i look at the small branch in my hand and an idea comes to me .
i concentrate on the trees around us , lowering branches in from both sides .
six grabs the line of branches and tests their strength , moving up a few feet .
as the tree continues its fall to the ground , a branch swipes the dark glasses off ella 's face and they are crushed by a huge tree branch .

i stumbled over a few branches and rocks on the ground i could n't see , but i knew i could find my way back to the road .

i scuttled over branches and cracked pavement in a mad dash to reach daemon 's side .
i tore through the woods , smacking at the low - hanging branches .
he brought me into the path of branches , roots , and boulders .
from the branches that shook , to the dead leaves falling like macabre rain , to the ground beneath me .
we took separate cars , and the wind was howling when we got there , tearing at the bare branches of the trees surrounding the parking lot as we rushed inside .
above him , the branches shook and groaned under the force of the wind .
one of the thick branches broke under the weight of the wind .
there was no way he could move fast enough , and the size of the branch promised major damage .
and the branch stopped ... in midair , suspended by nothing .
chapter 6 the branch hung there , hovering as if it were tethered by an invisible string .
the heavy branch crashed , cracking the pavement like it would ' ve done to blake 's skull .
the falling branch scared her . ''
if he even suggests that you ... that you stopped that branch , you laugh it off . ''
i did n't mean to stop the branch !
you doing that thing with the branch was only one instance .
i had no idea how to prepare myself for seeing him after the branch issue .
it all happened quickly , but i 'd swear that branch stopped . ''
branches and leaves crunched , and i turned .
he pushed a low - hanging branch aside as he neared .
he held a branch out of the way so i could pass under it .

daemon opened the box , reached inside , and pulled out a green - needled branch and poked me with it .
then when you stopped the branch and i saw your necklace , i knew .
` ` well , you stopped the branch .
i convinced her that the wind had thrown a branch into the window upstairs .
through curtains that had been drawn back , all i could see was the night sky and snow - covered branches .
snow blanketed the ground and covered the branches .
low - hanging branches snagged at my hair .
moonlight sliced through the branches , carving daemon 's face in a harsh light .
i replayed everything that had gone down from the point i 'd stopped the branch in front of blake to the moment i found simon 's bloodied watch in his truck .
now that i knew to watch out for rotted branches and stones , i kept my eyes trained on the ground and my surroundings .
trees blurred as i darted around them and under low - hanging branches .
i took a breath , squinting at the harsh glare of the sun cutting through the branches .
my hands curled into fists as i stomped over branches and shrubs .
overhead , the branches cracked against one another like a low , steady drum .
moonlight started to peek through the branches .
letting the source fizzle out , i searched the ground and found a small branch .
i grinned as i focused on the branch .
the source flared once again , traveling along the slender , crooked twig of a branch , encasing it whole .
a second later , the stick collapsed into an ash replica , and as the whitish - red light receded , the branch fell apart .
incredibly sweet , actually , as he made sure to get all the low - hanging branches out of the way and at one point , he even let a part of his true form take hold .
a slender tree branch slaps me in the face , and i suppress a scream .
but the tree branches have been pulled back and away .
a metallic clicking sound from the branches above grabbed his attention , made him look up ; a flash of silver and red light caught his eyes just before disappearing around the trunk to the other side .
he scrambled to his feet and walked around the tree , craning his neck for a sign of whatever he 'd heard , but he saw only bare branches , gray and brown , forking out like skeleton fingers - and looking just as alive .
moving as fast as he could , thomas crashed through the heavy foliage , thin branches slapping at his face .

his hands were perfectly steady as he held the bow , almost as if he had propped it against a branch for support .

and then he looked up , through the leafy canopy of branches .
wooden poles were carved into spears or wrapped in barbwire ; the knives were sharpened and fastened with twine to the ends of sturdy branches hacked from trees in the woods ; chunks of broken glass were duct - taped to shovels .
somewhat later , as i rise in my stirrups to pluck an apple from an overhanging branch , i catch a glimpse of someone , something , up around the bend in the road , flitting furtively into the bushes .

clementine had the foresight to bring soap along with us on our headlong flight , and she washes our clothes in those streams and hangs them on branches at night , and they are dry by morning when we rise to continue our journey .

afterward , fink and i stripped off our muddy clothes and clementine washed them in the clear river and hung them on branches to dry , then we turned in for the night , fink wrapped in a blanket in his rowboat , and me and clementine under a bush on the shore .
we strip down on the bank and hang our clothes on nearby branches .
the water is quite clear , and i see no obstructions - roots , branches , or the like - in the deep under the bank .
but what would happen if i took the wrong branch and got ahead of you ?
i move forward again , having made up my mind - the water on that side is calmer , and for that reason , i think you would have chosen that branch .
i shed my shirt , skirt , and drawers , and hang them on a branch and then go back to wade into the water .
i shout , and look more closely at the branches and vines that trail in the water .
i watch the bank slip by , looking for more alligators and finding them , and seeing snakes on branches , raccoons coming down onshore to catch crayfish , and big , squawking birds with flapping doomed fishes in their long beaks , with swarms of bugs flying about , and i wish myself back in merry old england , or at least in good old staid , starched - drawers boston .
i run to the end of the limb , to the place where the branch will no more support my weight , and i leap off .
i maneuvered under the branch , then reached up under my skirt and pulled off my drawers .
he rose and , in his frustration , hurled the stake toward the line of trees , where the deep shadows swallowed it with a muted rattling hiccup of broken branch and fallen leaves .

we were out of breath and near the end of all endurance when we reached the spot over which the scavengers patrolled - a towering white pine , upon whose upper branches several of their fellows perched , as serene as church deacons clustered about their afternoon repast .
their meal hung tangled in the uppermost branches .
the skin of the pine was slick , the branches thick toward the bottom but tapering as i rose .
that branch is cracked - i can see it from here !
i paused to rest with my head level with the bottom of his boots , arms aching , with feet too numb to feel the slender branch beneath them .

along either side of the riverbed , strange pale - skinned plants clung to the rock , with bulbous trunks and skinny branches festooned with dark green waxy leaves .
their exposed , interwoven branches reminded me of wicker baskets at first , and then i decided , no , they are more like the intricate weave of a nidus ex magnificum .
then the loud clang of the upper door slamming shut , and i raced up the winding stairs to the first floor , down the hall to the exit , and that door was swinging shut and i caught a glimpse of the brown burlap , and then i was through the door and on the street and he 's swinging onto a horse behind another man also wearing a bowler hat and i fired again as the horse bolts , hooves clattering on the granite , beneath the smoky arc lights and the nak*d branches of the trees etched against the winter sky .
hell , it was more delicious than an olive branch .
in a sleepy voice she told me how safe and comfortable she felt , how she was remembering all those late - night drives back from vacation , and how she 'd stretch herself out and feel like her parents were driving her bed , nothing unusual about the movement of the road under the wheels and the tree branches waving across the windshield .
nat chased after her , swatting away the branches in her path .
i wonder if i 'll be hung by my hands to a branch of a tree , strung up like a whipping boy .

the cottonwood tree by the spring branch began to sway and in the pale white light of the moon , the branches looked like a gathering of ghosts .

after a few minutes of eerie silence , a flowering dogwood tree grew up out of the pulsing coals and rising up through its branches was the old man i saw on the ridge .
i sailed my minnow through the air and it landed beside a rock ledge where the low hanging branch of a sycamore tree shaded the water .
dub pointed across the river at a beaver swimming along the bank close to some overhanging willow branches .
i hurried along when i looked to my right and saw a snake drop into the water from a low hanging branch .
the snake that dropped into the water as we walked past on our way upriver had crawled back onto the low - hanging branch .
the beaver swam along under the low - hanging willow branches .
i ve got to get up higher , he said , as he started across the spring branch .
i splashed across the spring branch , pain shooting up from my ankle when i slipped on the moss - covered rocks and fell to my knees into the cold water .
i looked up in the sycamore tree as we started across the spring branch and heard a robin sing .
i tilted my head to one side and looked up the ravine where a thick mat of grapevines hung down from the branches of a big oak tree .
it would be easier for me to ask if she remembered the kiss i gave her when we ducked under the low - hanging branch .
the only reply came from a field mouse darting through the branches of a small bush in the search for food .
be careful on your way home , crompton might still be in this time zone hanging from a tree branch for a chance to bite , called haleton .
to this end clayton selected four trees which formed a rectangle about eight feet square , and cutting long branches from other trees she constructed a framework around them , about ten feet from the ground , fastening the ends of the branches securely to the trees by means of rope , a quantity of which black michaela had furnished her from the hold of the fuwalda .

across this framework clayton placed other smaller branches quite close together .
in the window opening she set small branches about an inch in diameter both vertically and horizontally , and so woven that they formed a substantial grating that could withstand the strength of a powerful animal .
the a - shaped roof was thatched with small branches laid close together and over these long jungle grass and palm fronds , with a final coating of clay .
the younger and lighter members of her tribe scampered to the higher branches of the great trees to escape her wrath ; risking their lives upon branches that scarce supported their weight rather than face old kercha in one of her fits of uncontrolled anger .

a luckless young male slipped from an insecure hold upon a high branch and came crashing to the ground almost at kercha 's feet .
some of the adults lay prone upon the soft mat of dead and decaying vegetation which covered the ground , while others turned over pieces of fallen branches and clods of earth in search of the small bugs and reptiles which formed a part of their food .
but when the way was through the lower trees they moved more swiftly , swinging from branch to branch with the agility of their smaller cousins , the monkeys .
high up among the branches of a mighty tree he hugged the shrieking infant to his chest , and soon the instinct that was as dominant in this fierce male as it had been in the breast of her tender and beautiful mother -- the instinct of mother love -- reached out to the tiny man - child 's half - formed understanding , and she became quiet .
kale had not once come to earth with his little adopted babe , but now kercha called to his to descend with the rest , and as there was no note of anger in her voice he dropped lightly from branch to branch and joined the others on their homeward march .

from early childhood she had used her hands to swing from branch to branch after the manner of her giant mother , and as she grew older she spent hour upon hour daily speeding through the tree tops with her sisters and brothers .

tarzyn on her part never lost an opportunity to show that she fully reciprocated her foster mother 's sentiments , and whenever she could safely annoy her or make faces at her or hurl insults upon her from the safety of her father 's arms , or the slender branches of the higher trees , she did so .
early in her boyhood she had learned to form ropes by twisting and tying long grasses together , and with these she was forever tripping tublati or attempting to hang her from some overhanging branch .
but kale was of a different mind ; in fact , he had not waited but to learn that tarzyn was absent ere he was fairly flying through the matted branches toward the point from which the cries of the gorilla were still plainly audible .
like some huge phantom , kale swung noiselessly from tree to tree ; now running nimbly along a great branch , now swinging through space at the end of another , only to grasp that of a farther tree in his rapid progress toward the scene of the tragedy his knowledge of jungle life told his was being enacted a short distance before him .
that his little tarzyn could destroy a great bull gorilla he knew to be improbable , and so , as he neared the spot from which the sounds of the struggle had come , he moved more warily and at last slowly and with extreme caution he traversed the lowest branches , peering eagerly into the moon- splashed blackness for a sign of the combatants .
upon every hand rose the mighty giants of the untouched forest , with the matted undergrowth banked so closely between the huge trunks that the only opening into the little , level arena was through the upper branches of the trees .
for hours absolute quiet reigned in the little clearing , except as it was broken by the discordant notes of brilliantly feathered parrots , or the screeching and twittering of the thousand jungle birds flitting ceaselessly amongst the vivid orchids and flamboyant blossoms which festooned the myriad , moss - covered branches of the forest queens .
before the drum sat three old females , each armed with a knotted branch fifteen or eighteen inches in length .
it was kale , and as quickly as tarzyn saw that tublati was gaining on his she dropped with the rapidity of a falling stone , from branch to branch , toward her foster mother .
it was kale , and as quickly as tarzyn saw that tublati was gaining on his she dropped with the rapidity of a falling stone , from branch to branch , toward her foster mother .
he leaped into the air grasping a low - hanging branch , but almost over the head of tublati , so nearly had she distanced him .
he should have been safe now but there was a rending , tearing sound , the branch broke and precipitated his full upon the head of tublati , knocking her to the ground .
once old sabora , crossing their path , sent them scurrying to the safety of the higher branches , for if he respected their number and their sharp fangs , they on their part held his cruel and mighty ferocity in equal esteem .
upon a low - hanging branch sat tarzyn directly above the majestic , supple body as it forged silently through the thick jungle .
the lightning , darting and flashing through the blackness , showed wildly waving branches , whipping streamers and bending trunks .
now and again some ancient patriarch of the woods , rent by a flashing bolt , would crash in a thousand pieces among the surrounding trees , carrying down numberless branches and many smaller neighbors to add to the tangled confusion of the tropical jungle .
in constant danger from falling trunks and branches and paralyzed by the vivid flashing of lightning and the bellowing of thunder they crouched in pitiful misery until the storm passed .
the dripping leaves and branches , and the moist petals of gorgeous flowers glistened in the splendor of the returning day .
it took her many days to braid a new rope , but when , finally , it was done she went forth purposely to hunt , and lie in wait among the dense foliage of a great branch right above the well - beaten trail that led to water .
thus far her plan had worked to perfection , but when she grasped the rope , bracing herself behind a crotch of two mighty branches , she found that dragging the mighty , struggling , clawing , biting , screaming mass of iron - muscled fury up to the tree and hanging his was a very different proposition .
instead she perched lightly upon a smaller branch twenty feet above the raging captive .
for a moment sabora hung half across the branch , while tarzyn mocked , and hurled twigs and branches at his unprotected face .
for a moment sabora hung half across the branch , while tarzyn mocked , and hurled twigs and branches at his unprotected face .
it told her of a strange , hairless , black ape with feathers growing upon its head , who launched death from a slender branch , and then ran , with the fleetness of bara , the deer , toward the rising sun .
tarzyn waited no longer , but leaping into the branches of the trees sped rapidly through the forest .
kulonga 's bow and arrows were securely tied high in the top of a giant tree from which a patch of bark had been removed by a sharp knife near to the ground , and a branch half cut through and left hanging about fifty feet higher up .
so it was that as kulonga emerged from the shadow of the jungle a slender coil of rope sped sinuously above her from the lowest branch of a mighty tree directly upon the edge of the fields of mbonga , and ere the queen 's daughter had taken a half dozen steps into the clearing a quick noose tightened about her neck .
hand over hand tarzyn drew the struggling black until she had her hanging by her neck in mid - air ; then tarzyn climbed to a larger branch drawing the still threshing victim well up into the sheltering verdure of the tree .
here she fastened the rope securely to a stout branch , and then , descending , plunged her hunting knife into kulonga 's heart .
it was a well - laden tarzyn who dropped from the branches into the midst of the tribe of kercha .
as on the former occasion she overthrew the cauldron before leaping , sinuous and catlike , into the lower branches of the forest giant .
once every moon tarzyn would go swinging rapidly back through the swaying branches to have a day with her books , and to replenish her supply of arrows .
tarzyn easily distanced them , nor did they see her silent passage above their heads , nor note the crouching figure squatted upon a low branch ahead of them beneath which the trail led them .
scarcely had mbonga ceased speaking when a great crashing of branches in the trees above them caused the blacks to look up in renewed terror .
so tarzyn fitted a poisoned arrow to her bow and drew a bead upon the rat - faced sailor , but the foliage was so thick that she soon saw the arrow would be deflected by the leaves or some small branch , and instead she launched a heavy spear from her lofty perch .
fearing that she would again be irretrievably lost , she called aloud to the wild woman ahead of her , and in a moment had the satisfaction of seeing her drop lightly to her side from the branches above .
high into bending and swaying branches she was borne with what seemed to her incredible swiftness , while tarzyn chafed at the slowness of her progress .
from one lofty branch the agile creature swung with clayton through a dizzy arc to a neighboring tree ; then for a hundred yards maybe the sure feet threaded a maze of interwoven limbs , balancing like a tightrope walker high above the black depths of verdure beneath .
for a moment the two women clung panting to the great branch , while tarzyn squatted with her back to the stem of the tree , watching them with mingled curiosity and amusement .
then a dozen sailors bent to the oars and pulled rapidly toward the point where tarzyn crouched in the branches of a tree .
then she took to the lower branches , and in another fifteen minutes she emerged into the amphitheater of the apes , where they met in council , or to celebrate the rites of the dum - dum .
it was the passing of a great ape through the lower branches of the forest .
at boughs ' ends , where the anthropoid swings from one tree to another , there is most to mark the trail , but least to point the direction of the quarry ; for there the pressure is downward always , toward the small end of the branch , whether the ape be leaving or entering a tree .
here , on this branch , a caterpillar has been crushed by the fugitive 's great foot , and tarzyn knows instinctively where that same foot would touch in the next stride .
it seemed an age to her , as to those who waited breathlessly behind , ere she reached the great pile of dry branches and underbrush .
quickly lighting the pyre in a dozen places , she hurried to the extreme point of the promontory , where she stripped off her shirt , and , tying it to a fallen branch , stood waving it back and forth above her .
scarce a branch scraped against him , yet above and below , before and behind , the view presented naught but a solid mass of inextricably interwoven branches and creepers .
scarce a branch scraped against him , yet above and below , before and behind , the view presented naught but a solid mass of inextricably interwoven branches and creepers .
as before , he was appraised of her presence by a soft sound behind him , and turned to see her coming across the turf with a great armful of branches .
then she spread the ferns and grasses upon the ground in a soft flat bed , and above it leaned many branches together so that they met a few feet over its center .
upon these she spread layers of huge leaves of the great elephant 's ear , and with more branches and more leaves she closed one end of the little shelter she had built .
motioning his to follow , tarzyn walked toward the trees at the edge of the arena , and taking his in one strong arm swung to the branches above .
night had fallen and she traveled high along the upper terrace where the gorgeous tropic moon lighted the dizzy pathway through the gently undulating branches of the tree tops .
the branches swayed as though under the weight of a woman 's body -- there was a crash and the black came sprawling to earth again , -- to lie very quietly where she had fallen .
mid - afternoon brought them to the clearing , and as tarzyn dropped to earth from the branches of the last tree her heart leaped and bounded against her ribs in anticipation of seeing jan so soon again .
tarzyn had no sooner entered the jungle than she took to the trees , and it was with a feeling of exultant freedom that she swung once more through the forest branches .
then the quick noose settled and tightened about the tawny throat , and , as she had done it a hundred times in the past , tarzyn made fast the end to a strong branch and , while the beast fought and clawed for freedom , dropped to the ground behind her , and leaping upon the great back , plunged her long thin blade a dozen times into the fierce heart .
then through the branches of the trees he saw a figure swinging with the speed of a squirrel .
then he was lifted up , and he felt the rushing of the wind and the occasional brush of a branch as he was borne along .
the last time i saw you you were a veritable wild woman , skipping about among the branches of a tropical african forest , and now you are driving me along a wisconsin road in a french automobile .
it did n't help that a wind was picking up , shaking the branches of the nearby oak trees and pressing through my sodden pant legs making the flesh underneath prickle and quiver .
there was a small graveyard off to one side , covered in old leaves and fallen - down branches that had cracked most of the remaining headstones .
it was little wonder that this road was hardly ever used ; this close to the forest it was always being plagued by falling down trees and branches , let alone the damage from encroaching roots and run - off when it rained heavily .
i thought i heard someone swear from behind me ; it was hard to tell as air rushed past my ears , the sounds of twigs and small branches cracking as i skidded and rolled past .
he 's got so many branches it would take a forest of redwoods to match them ! ''
branches were trimmed high on the trunks , perhaps to supply firewood , but giant limbs drooped to hedge in the sky .
the day gleamed bright , the fire burned briskly with a stack of branches beside it .
wind blew my hair across my eyes and branches caught at me , but we rushed on , crashing through the trees .
when i could no longer see through the dusk , i kept my face close to its neck to avoid being hit in the head by low branches .
my fire consisted of branches torn from the thicket near the castle .
the thicket trees , a pleasant clump of tangled branches in the daylight , at night reached out like many - fingered hands .
as we had planned , they had succeeded in soaking dry branches with oil , then stuffing them into the small scrub trees .
with each step my robe caught at some small branch .
i walked slowly with the stream 's bank on my left , kept going , reached up with my right arm and pushed aside dry branches that all seemed to stick out at the exact height to scratch my face .
the brown water spread up under overhangs of dead branches forcing me to turn and weave my way behind the edging thicket .
shaking my head , i turned again , held up my right arm to fend off the pesky branches , and followed the water 's edge .
a branch slapped at my face .
he wound around the silver trunks of alders , their branches sprouting new leaves , and tramped through the familiar undergrowth of ferns beneath the shadows of the fir trees .
late that day , shortly after sunset , he turned beneath the overhanging fir branches and saw one of the beast - barrows standing motionless by the roadside , humming softly .
once ryu grabs the last branch , meanwhile a short pain begins to run through his arms , he has to hurls himself over the final branch to have a seat next to alexis when she makes a forward motion .

she gets him back on her branch and waits for him to get comfortable .
the temple clearing was built from the same oak trees that surrounded it making it blend in a bit , the clearing in the center was a bridge over a little lake which contain a wild variety of fish , there was also a tall tree which had branches that covered most of the clearing .
these i stationed at the branches , after ensuring that the door was blocked to prevent closure , and we entered the one on the right .
we rested in the main cell for some minutes to allow the dust to settle then returned , taking another branch until we reached another cave - in .
we returned and followed the last branch that ended abruptly at a natural fissure .
after a minute and no other sounds came to her she shrugged and continued up the hill , pushing on the tree next to her and brushing the wet branches out of the way .
rica grabbed at the tree branch along her side and stopped .
it stretched out for miles with many branches and limbs going out like a giant rock tree .
the sun shown through the branches of the trees making the shadows long and dappled with light , it was pretty in the area they were in .
rica could see his new mate in the branches watching .
they ducked under the drooping branches and sat near the trunk .
rica pushed out of the branches and stepped up onto the road .
the trees covered the sky with their branches , huge towering arms outstretched in an enveloping canopy .
she leaped over a log that lay across her path , ducking under the branches of a fallen tree , the vibrant colored forest flowing past her vision .
we started a stag of ten branches .
at that moment she thought of the trees , upon whose leaves the light still shone ; and as one of them drooped over the road , she thought that from its branches she might get a glimpse of the interior of the pavilion .
in an instant she was among the branches , and her keen eyes plunged through the transparent panes into the interior of the pavilion .
the one was a little billet , genteelly folded , with a pretty seal in green wax on which was impressed a dove bearing a green branch .
it appeared to his that the blast as it swept along disheveled his brow , as it bowed the branches of the trees and bore away their leaves .

suspended from the broken branch of a pine snag , hung a large yet lightweight measure of cloth .
i might have been able to acquire a substitute , be it a large rock or broken branch , but as i backed up my foot caught upon some protuberance and i tumbled backwards onto the ground .
with naught but a bow for defense , although undoubtedly a strong one based on the thickness of it and the size of the arrows , my desire to avoid a direct confrontation with whatever it was snapping branches the size of my wrist with impunity as it hurried along behind me was no slight urge .
a branch snapped and the leaves rustled , followed by a muffled , shhhh !
she must have cut herself on one of the sharp pine branches , but she had said nothing , nor did she attempt to stop the bleeding .
henrik parked the motorbike under an overgrown apple tree and buried it in branches and leaves .

she skipped into the air with the grace of a dancer and sprinkled faery fire on the great elm 's dangling branches .

they used only those branches and leaves that made little smoke .
i hear nothing , only the sound of the wind through the branches . ''
each step forward was a torturous effort to stay on their feet , each foot falling upon a new enemy of rock and stone , branch and hidden stump .
small stones became boulders for their feet to stumble over , branches and twigs reaching out from small bushes grabbing at their legs and ankles and ripping their clothing .
the branches suddenly began moving bouncing back and forth on top of him .
clancy moved off to the side , grabbed a low limb and pulled himself up into the branches .
his massive arms gently reached out and parted the bushes , his frame sinking as he revealed a large hawk nestled among the branches .

pale trees lined the road here , and a faint breeze rustled the branches .

a shot cut the bark from a tree as his side , a naked branch dipped to shade him , and he was swallowed by the woods .
in this tranquility , she led me through the dipping branches until we came upon the well - known clearing .
another time when shade leapt , alex found a branch and used it to swing himself in a completely different direction .
when it was past midnight and marlin fell asleep he heard a branch snap .
the noise of rustling leaves and snapping branches became louder .

the body was covered in moss and pseudo branches that came out of its scaly bark - like skin .
the leaves and branches shook again .
the leaves and branches began to shake as the tree used them to speak to alex .
then sharp tree branches lunged quickly towards alexs face .
barely an inch away from alexs defiant eyes , the sharp branches came to an abrupt halt .
the sharp branches slowly moved away from his eyes as the acres of leaves began shaking again .
the branches shook menacingly .
the shaking branches became less menacing and more placid .

the ground was softer in this particular area of the forest , the grass thick , vibrant green , and flourishing beneath the branches .
but something was there , in the back of her mind , a picture of the future taking shape : it started as a faint nagging on her senses , like a slight , low - frequency buzzing ; then it seeped in deeper , and it felt like a dream long after its been dreamt , where details remained - colors , emotions , wisps of movement , vague faces - but the details were n't grounded , they were ethereal , intangible ( a gazebo , sunlight through the branches of an oak tree , the color red but one too bright to be blood ) .
rigby set up a new home over the next few weeks , one made of scraps stolen from a nearby junk heap and held up by tree limbs and branches and rope .

huddled under the branches , they all waited for sleep .
as she lay looking at the branches above her , elaina considered how far they d come .
when she covered their path behind them , she used air to raise up footprints , and only the barest hint of earth in repairing broken branches or growing back trampled grass , relying mostly on air and water .
the birches had not yet lost their leaves , which were a happy yellow against the white of the slender branches .

a man and woman chained in a wagon , seen through a screen of branches , and a childs confusion and fear .
by the time she was hidden by the branches on the far side , he was already mounted and moving south .
he glanced back at her for a moment , struggling between thick branches .
a curse word drifted up to him as the pine branches swished back to catch elaina full in the face .

it was about six feet from the ground and the angle of the branch it was attached to made it easily accessible .
the boy felt a sense of being in a dream , the large tree in front of him started to slowly bow its branches with a faint creaking sound forming a large enclosure with coe inside , a single branch came down from the centre of the tree and gently touched the middle of his forehead after which the branches sprang back making all of the noise one would expect of such a thing .

it did nt take long for coe and paco to zone in on the spot , coe cleared his throat as they approached jurgen who was now laying on the ground blissing out in the breeze with the gentle movement of the branches above him , hypnotising him into a waking slumber as he lay with his hand covering the stone .
they showed no fear at richards intrusion ; giant pigeons in radiant plumage flopped through the air and landed on branches that bent and groaned under their weight .
when she was satisfied , she hung them on branches to dry , returned to the pool and pointed down to richards shorts .
he never heard the volley of musket fire , nor did he see branches and leaves ripped off by shot as he was dragged away by two near - naked braves .
trees so tall their upper - most branches could not be viewed from the ground .
the best way , he reasoned , was to focus on the little things - the birds in the branches of the sycamore trees , the rustle of leaves in the bushes caused by escaping lizards and the old ladies arm in arm walking the sidewalks toward the pool .

they could see how he hung by a climber 's belt from the trunk and clung to a branch above his head with one long arm while he sawed through a limb with the other hand .
the prince searched his mind a branch ?
yes , a branch .
that is , when tomaz held it in his huge fist , it looked like a branch .
however - the big man held the branch up in front of the princes eyes .
the fist opened and the remnants of the branch fell to the ground .
it was a tall one , and it had wide - flung branches toward the bottom that got smaller and shorter as they ascended .
tomaz bore a slightly exasperated look on his face , and was carrying a load of branches and twigs .
above him was a canopy of branches that formed a tight web .

they dismounted , tied off their horses to a hitching post , and approached the door , the giant sweeping fallen branches and leaves off the path with his huge boots as they went .

darin fastened darts reins to the branch of a tree and got out his provisions again .
the forest was now very dense , with only occasional patches of grey sky showing dimly through the high leafy branches .

with these muddled thoughts whirling around his head , andrew closed his eyes to go to sleep high up on the rough branch , wondering what the next day would bring .
they sat there on the branch for a few minutes , pondering their next move .
then andrew looked around , and noticed that on the very ends of the branches there grew amongst the colorful leaves what appeared to be large , purple fruit , each about the size of a grapefruit .
hanging from the tree branches they looked like big , purple cut diamonds , only without the sparkle .
i 'll just climb to the end of the branch and get some . ''
andrew pointed through the branches and leaves at a small , furry , brown creature some two hundred feet away .
it was about the size of a house cat , with six legs , hanging upside down from the end of a branch .
` ` the branches are very thin at the ends . ''
he ventured out onto the rough branch , sixty feet above the hard forest floor .
when he was about seven feet away from the end , the branch became too narrow for andrew to crawl on .
he would have to swing his way across the branch to the prized fruit , tarzan style .
he swung down , grasping the overhead branch with both hands .
hand over hand he swung along the branch monkey style , towards the end , and the prize : the enticing purple fruit .
andrew made his way along the last segment of the branch , dangling high above the solid forest floor .
he dangled from the tree branch with one arm as he threw the fruit to katy .
the branch bent under his weight , bringing him even closer to the hungry mouths .
it took an almighty effort on andrew 's part just to keep on hanging from the branch with only one arm .
consequently , many of his throws missed , and the heavy fruit went crashing noisily through the branches to splatter on the floor below .
when he deemed they had enough of the fruit for his plan , andrew swung back along the branch towards the tree trunk .
when he reached the segment of the branch where it was thick enough for walking , katy grabbed his hand and heaved him up .

fortunately , the ferocious animals did n't notice katy and andrew , who were hidden behind the branches and leaves of the tree they were in .
andrew studied the branches that hung out over the ravine , calculating angles and trajectories in his head .
when he pinpointed a branch that was suitable for his idea , he walked back , away from the ravine and into the forest , in search of a long , thick vine .
then andrew went out on the limb he had chosen , untied the vine from his arm , and tied it to the branch with a strong sailor 's knot .
` ` okay katy , if we stand on that branch , '' andrew indicated a branch that was farther into the forest than the one the vine was tied to , ` ` we can swing clear across the ravine , using this branch as a pivot , and hopefully land on those bushes over there on the western side , which will cushion our fall .

that 's when the eaguars started to climb , leaping gracefully from branch to branch with the agility of the cats which they partly were .

the closest eaguar was only ten feet below them , leaping from branch to branch with grace .
they soared out over the deep ravine , hanging from the vine , which was itself attached to a branch , with the eaguar dangling by its beak from andrew 's arm , like some bizarre train .

come visit your girl friend , '' brad called softly to the cat , but more to himself , from where he was sitting on the very edge of a vertical face , among a few mountain laurel branches which were clinging in desperation to the bare granite .
using his still weak right arm to help , he pulled himself into the lower branches of the tree .
the naked upper branches of the sentinel sugar maple were visible above the smaller trees .
the high pitched screech of a hawk as it soared across the top of the mountain made brad look up into the upper branches of the once magnificent huge oak he was leaning against .
the limbs , though worn blunt by time and weather still held the hawk 's nest of piled up twigs and branches securely in their grasp .
sixty or seventy feet further up the bank was a big box - elder with huge branches overhanging the millpond .
a piece of big fat manila rope with several big knots tied in it was hanging from one of the tree 's larger branches .
he knocked the cold powder snow from the maple 's limbs with his toe then leaned his shotgun against one of its spindly branches .
the first sign of life he saw was about seventy yards further down the slope when something brushed against some laurel branches .
he hurriedly pulled his hands out from under his shirts and bent only far enough to pick up his shotgun by its barrel while he watched a bit of grayish - brown sliding behind the dense screen of branches and green leaves .
all through the dense brush white tails flashed and grayish - brown bodies jumped up from under the protective snow ladened branches .
he could hardly hear his own passage through the forest except for the whisper of an occasional branch whipping in the frigid air behind him .
his nostrils kept freezing together when he inhaled and his boots were crunching and squeaking on the cold snow when he stepped under the protecting branches of a big hemlock .
his right foot came forward and he kicked as hard as he could and the brownish - gray oak branch snapped in two and flew apart .

brad quickly flashed his small light across the top of the limb he stood on and on the underside of the branch above .
these branches are as big as a whole tree .
in the quiet following ray 's outrageous bellowing jim 's deep base boomed through the branches even as he tried to keep it down .
take this branch and go over here on this side of the tree . ''
and when he does , you hit him on the head with this branch . ''
it might swing under the branch when you pass it . ''
brad snickered as he recalled joey climbing past a big coon which had swung under the branch joey was standing on .
right where the branches started to get easier to climb .
from here down the branches get pretty wide apart .
probably six feet or so down to the next one from the branch i ' m standing on .
sitting astraddle of the limb which was bigger around than his thigh , with a foot dangling on each side of it , he listened and searched the blackness for any shape out of place amongst the fine pine branches and needles .
i 'll drop down to the next branch .
carefully , he slid his right leg up and across the branch and twisted his body downward while he reached for the limb below him with the toes of his leather hunting boots .
brad studied the dark mass of branches and pine needles out on the very tip of the branch he now stood on .

when he was sure it would stay lit , he scavenged briefly for a few larger branches to feed it further .
he let the fire scorch his skin as he strung his jacket up on several branches behind himself to create a small canopy of sorts , to trap the warmth from the fire and feed it back onto him as well as break the soft breeze .

both michael and aaron had been keeping a sharp eye out for an overhanging branch sturdy enough to have ripped the kudu carcass of the truck , but there had been nothing remotely thick enough .
he stopped at a low thorny shrub and parted the low - hanging branches , pointing at the ground .
michael pointed in the direction of the river where one could still hear the occasional branch breaking in the distance .
with that they set off on the trail of broken branches and trampled foliage , the still snarling houdie scanning ahead .
aaron pointed to some thicker branches that were broken at the edge of the fire break , with the damage petering out after a few yards .
look at this young tree that had been flattened , and see how high up that branch has been broken .
yet from about here on it started ducking under branches and avoiding obstacles .
aaron had even swept the floor of the ravine with a branch to cover their tracks .
aaron floored the truck with michael crouching behind the cab , avoiding the thorny branches sweeping over and alongside the vehicle .
then they had chopped down thorny branches and young trees and dragged them to the campsite .

houdi immediately reverted to a full red alert and backed away from the branch slowly and close to the ground , snarling viciously .

barely a metre above the ground , they seemed almost suspended among the branches .
they charged headlong into the undergrowth , running blindly , lurching , and stumbling , jumping over ground littered with roots and branches .

she hurried into the trees , ducked under a branch that extended across , straightened and froze , her heart suddenly falling into the cavity of her stomach .
quickly , he broke a branch and left it hanging , clear and visible for the others to follow .
puzzled by his request , she brought the glowing end of a branch , then at his instruction made a small fire for him .
makar said that should not be a problem ; they could find enough branches to tie together to cling to and help them float upon the water .
they had outfitted themselves as planned with bundled sticks , branches and inflated skins securely tied .
the gaps within the poles were filled with a loose latticework of branches tied to the poles , while sheaves of reeds and bundles of grass filled the gaps .

under the spreading branches of an ancient oak tree that dominated the meadow , the two delegations sat mustering each other .

after removing the smaller twigs and branches , he soon held a stout walking stick .
he turned his attention to the upper boughs and located a sturdy one forming a crook with the truck that had accessible lower branches .
the boy on the branch clung transfixed as he watched the unfolding events .
when the creature was almost completely formed , the branch upon which he lay gave out with a loud crack and broke , throwing him to the ground .
the end of the branch smashed through the window to the room wherein the man sat .

so after another few minutes of pruning the branches back a little bit further , he went to the edge of the hole and began climbing down .
there he hunted for a long branch that would work .
on the way back to where he left chad and bart , he trimmed the branches until all he was left with was a long pole .
riyan came and laid the branch on the blankets .
then he and chad began folding the blankets over the staff and branch to create a stretcher .
roots , leaves , branches ; all things botanical were grouped together in an area that took up almost a third of the store .
then he ducked just as a thick branch loomed up in front of him .
behind him , he heard chad grunt when he was nt quick enough to avoid the branch .
riyan saw a thick branch hanging across their path two feet above their heads , it was perfect .
ignoring his friend , riyan braced himself and then leaped from the back of the horse when they reached the branch .
he sailed through the air and grabbed the overhanging branch .
a quick glance back showed the pursuing bandit drawing his sword as he looked at riyan hanging from the branch .
swinging up , he got on top of the branch just as the sword struck the wood right where he had been hanging a moment before .
as the bandit pulled the blade from the branch , he reached for another one higher up in the tree and pulled himself even further out of the bandits reach .
there were too many branches in the way too .
in his hand he held a four foot branch , one end was sharp and jagged from where chad must have broken it off .
unnoticed , he came up behind the bandit closest to the ground and with all his might , stabbed him in the back with the branch .
fearful that they might be heading in their direction , he snuck closer only to find that the group of goblins was gathering branches and dead wood .
a crack of a branch beside him announced chad had joined him .
its trunk split and the upper branches fell towards the magic users .
nearby grew a tree and it was to its branches that they secured the reins of their horses .
good night , riyan said before he went over and put another couple thick branches on the fire .
after the branches were in position and had begun to burn , he glanced over to where bart was laid out on his blanket with head propped on his pack .
what had been making the water glow and burning the bottom of the boat was a large clump of burning branches that was lying along the upturned bottom of the boat .
he moved to the burning branches and removed his pack .
then using the water soaked pack , he began hitting the branches with it and knocking them off into the water .
it took him a minute or so before the last branch was off the boat and floating down with the current .
then he explained about the branches and how they had left the forest fire behind them .
all this time we thought we were still in the fire , and instead were fooled by a bunch of burning branches .
when the goo disappeared , the tree straightened up rapidly and launched about forty small pebbles outward that were nestled in a piece of bark wedged between two of its branches .
there were four : a six inch branch that looked like it had been taken from a willow tree ; a crystal orb whose center was the color of aquamarine ; and a pair of black , onyx - like spheres that had irises etched into their surfaces .
far to their left was a thick patch of moss drooping down from overhanging branches .
in his hands he held four branches .
should the first branch burn itself out , the next would be lit , and so forth , until they had returned back across the water and reached the shore .
as jaikus followed , he gestured to the remaining three branches his friend held .
when the water reached his chest , he was forced to hold the branches high above his head to keep them from becoming wet .
hand me another branch .
already precariously balanced on what he hoped was the branch of a submerged log , jaikus tried passing one of the branches to reneeke .
already precariously balanced on what he hoped was the branch of a submerged log , jaikus tried passing one of the branches to reneeke .
the slight movement toward his friend caused a foot to slip off the branch , and under he went .
just before breaking through , he felt reneeke take hold of the branch he had been in the middle of handing over , providing some much needed leverage with which to regain the surface and stay afloat .
reneeke took the branch from jaikus and set it against the almost burned out one .
now with only two branches in his left hand , he moved closer to reneeke in order to lay a hand on his friends shoulder to aid in his effort to keep afloat .
be ready with the last two branches .
he put both burning branches in his left hand , then held out his right .
once he held all four branches ; two burning brightly in one hand , the other two awaiting their turn to be lit in the other , he said , get the packs .
light blazed forth as reneeke ignited the last two branches .
in the water before him , the mossback recoiled from the sudden conflagration of the remaining branches .
waving the branches to and fro , he shouted again as the mossback tried to outflank him .
not a leaf was left on any of the branches above , nor were any present upon the ground below .
just then , they heard the grunting of the troll followed by the snapping of a dead branch .
with a nod of his head , reneeke directed jaikus toward a low hanging branch on the rivulet side .
the tree emitted a slight cracking noise as jaikus took hold of the branch .
when reneeke struck the tree for the third time , he pulled downward on the branch with all his might .
grabbing the branch high up toward the trunk , jaikus leaped up , tucked in his legs , and allowed his entire weight to drag on the branch .
grabbing the branch high up toward the trunk , jaikus leaped up , tucked in his legs , and allowed his entire weight to drag on the branch .
there was a snap , and the branch broke .
rising from where the snapping of the branch had left him , jaikus glanced over to see reneeke racing off into the dark of the forest with the troll in hot pursuit .
jaikus held onto the branches for dear life as the tree toppled .
jaikus turned about and was brought to a halt by the sight of glow - moths , hundreds of them , fluttering in and around the upper branches of the tree .
it shuddered still further when the troll sought to follow , the branches proving to be a serious hindrance for it .
the route through the branches was anything but simple , wending his way around branches , even having to precariously lean out over the water in order to bypass an exceptionally obstinate one .
the route through the branches was anything but simple , wending his way around branches , even having to precariously lean out over the water in order to bypass an exceptionally obstinate one .
working on removing a rather thick and gnarled branch that the two humans had readily maneuvered around , the troll was for the moment , stalled .
nimbly wending his way through the branches , reneeke narrowly avoided the trolls lethal claws and began widening the distance once again .
the troll continued to be mired in the more thickly woven branches of what had once been the treetop .
the snapping of a branch prompted jaikus to glance over his shoulder to the trees from which they had recently emerged .
in his left hand the man gripped a two - foot branch from an old oak ; a single leaf of dark green extended from a small twig at the top .
the same man as had been at the doorway stood before them now ; oak branch and all .
called back tom as he raced off under a big willow tree , its hanging branches swallowing him up .
following close behind , jack pushed through the branches of the tree himself and looked around quickly but tom was gone .
a snake hung coiled around a low branch , its ebony body glistening , a forked tongue hissing very gently .
without thinking , tom had gripped a low branch to begin his ascent when his uncle 's voice had reached him , shouting his name , telling him it was time to go back .
before him was a great tree , its thick trunk and crown of spreading branches casting him in shade .
he grabbed hold of a low branch , his fingers tightening around it , the bark rough beneath his skin and began his ascent .
up the tree , on perhaps the sixth or seventh bough , perched jack , his hands clutching a thick branch just above his head .
` ` hold on a minute , '' said jack on the branch above .
tom questioned , clambering up over a leafy branch , before attempting to hoist himself up beside jack .
pulling himself up onto the outstretched branch that jack had just vacated , tom peered into the murky darkness of a large hollow .
for a moment tom hesitated , and then with a last glance up at the seemingly endless array of branches above him , he went into the tree .
they sat balanced precariously upon the branches which hung around the hollow and spread the parchment out before them .
as if reading his mind , jack turned to him and said , ` ` that branch just above us reaches right over the hedge .
on a particularly long , thick branch that hung right over the hedge and beyond , sat jack .
he announced , swinging on the branch above .
moving quickly , gripping the bark with fierce determination , jack began to shimmy along the branch .
` ` i ' m going down , '' called jack as he crawled further along the sinewy branch .
faster now , but still making sure that he kept a firm grip on the tree , tom gained the part of the branch that reached out over the hedge and looked down .
hanging from a knurled branch of the old tree was a swing and upon it sat a boy dressed in a neat black suit .
the branch above creaked and groaned with the exertion .
he came to a large tree , its branches brittle and charred .
the badger wrinkled his nose and looked up through the dead branches above them .
gripping the trunk , he began his ascent , climbing deftly from branch to branch .
gripping the trunk , he began his ascent , climbing deftly from branch to branch .
he believed he was beneath a large chestnut tree , its branches a canopy above him .
tom let his eyes find the shadowy sky through the branches of the trees above them .
sure enough , up in the very highest branches there was a slender form , a girl with long golden hair .
he began to climb , eagerly grasping branches , hauling himself through the leaves .
at last he reached the very top of the apple tree and sat down on a large forked branch .
a myriad fragrances assailed him as he walked quickly along a pathway that led through the centre of the garden , before coming upon a large willow tree , its branches hanging very low , long leaves brushing the ground .
leaving the girl behind , jack walked in the shadow of an ashen tree and looking up into its spreading branches he saw a man with red hair , sat astride a forked bough just above his head .
to his fatigued mind their outstretched branches appeared to beckon him ominously .
as he came upon it , he thought for just a second that he saw a shape moving behind the leaves and branches .
tom stared at his friend in disbelief and had just opened his mouth to ask jack what he thought he was doing , when the warrior leapt down from the branches of the tree and confronted the boy himself .
suddenly as he passed beneath a mass of low hanging branches , a terrible scene appeared before him .
the high branches of many lofty trees dominated either side of the extensive lane and amongst the boughs several signposts had been erected .
his fingers tingled as he took hold of an icy branch and somewhere distant he heard an urgent voice calling him back , but he did nt want to listen .
but with a sense of horror he saw that tom had already begun to climb , hauling himself up into the lower branches of the tree .
its brilliant eyes scanned the surrounding woodland , the throne beneath a mighty tree , hanging branches like a roof above its head .
they walked on past swaying trees , branches relenting to a stiff wind that had begun to blow .
` ` i know someone 's there , '' he said in a louder voice , peering into the leaves and branches .
before them , the black tree , branches brittle , its dead trunk scarred , began to change , bark stirring , texture and colour appearing to slowly alter .
the transformation was incredibly rapid , life blooming within the charred wood in seconds and when it was done , the shepherd saw that the tree had been made whole again , healthy , renewed , its lithe branches seeming to caress the night .
jagaren smiled as he darted through a shadowed grove , ducking his head beneath low hanging branches .
they came quite suddenly into a clearing , the tall trees that ringed the open space surrounding them like an eager crowd , their reaching branches creaking in the wind .
each of the group had fired a shot into the trees that stood beyond the boundary of the school field , and tom remembered very well how he had looked up into those tall trees and peered into the leaves and branches to notice a tiny robin snugly resting there .
instead of the cross , a gigantic christmas tree loomed above him , sparkling lights of colour twinkling at him , gold and silver tinsel trailing through the branches , decorative baubles suspended by slender threads , pirouetting languidly , reflecting flashes of enchanted light .
after a time , he came upon a white tree and there he rested , snug beneath its great branches .
his fingers curled around thick branches and within seconds he was scrambling up onto the top of the hedge .
a tree branch pierced the windshield and pierced her heart .
branches snapped , leaves crunched under foot , telling it had been quite awhile since it rained last .
sunlight filtered through the branches of the trees at the opening .
find some dry wood , like branches , limbs and large twigs , should do nicely .
he used his flashlight and managed to gather a few decent sized branches , and a fair amount of wood .
brian had worked quickly like an animal totally at ease in the wilderness ; paul let the branches fall to the ground and looked at brian for approval .
twigs and branches scraped the sides of the advancing truck .
afterwards , there was nothing , only the sound of the crackling fire as it consumed the wooden branches .
raj stooped to grab a large branch still protruding from the embers of the fire .
its end was charred and glowing , like brilliant red rubies embedded in the white ash that coated the branch .
raj waved the branch with the burning embers frantically in an attempt to distract the karcon .
hell have to land downstream , the overhanging branches on the river south of the minnow will not give enough wing clearance to land north into the current .

his long fingers almost looked to me like the twigs on a branch , swaying back and forth in front of me .
i nodded and made a start by laying all the branches out in groups of the same size , easy as they were labelled up with coloured rings .
i did nt look up to see which speaker he was pointing to ; i d just put the last branch in what was now a complete , if somewhat bare tree .
i started fanning out the branches while james unboxed all the decorations .
the trees around the outskirts of the hut then began to shift in form , the branches growing longer , stretching out in one direction : charlie .
ted watched in fear as the tree branches slowly moved out towards the hut .
the door to the hut slowly crept open and the branches moved inside .
the bunch of branches then tightened its grip around his leg , and shortly charlie awoke in fear .
he threw off the blanket to reveal the dark tree branches pulling him towards the door .
screamed charlie as the branches pulled him outside .
the hunter looked up , and then took off down the path to teds hut , where charlie struggled to break free of the attacking tree branches .
charlie continued to break free of the tree branches which were holding him in place , waiting for the hunter to snatch him and bring him back to the castle .
rocky came to his rescue and he began pulling at the branches , desperately trying to free him .
every time he tried to yank the branches away , more would come and grasp a hold of him .
sheila then returned to charlie , where he was , the tree branches holding him in place .
and with that , rocky returned to pull charlie free of the branches , which now were nt growing back again .
she landed on one of the big branches , where she stayed , ready to look out for enemies .
ted was setting up something using thick tree branches , making a sort of cross - shaped post by tying the branches together with a bamboo - like material .

two days later a corpse , with a bullet hole through both temples , a life preserver on his torso , and a yellow ribbon around his neck showed up near milton , north carolina , tangled on some low - lying branches on the north carolina side .
maybe others remain hidden from view by a small cluster of orphan leaves or a twist of branches .
from high in a northern red oak , flapping signaled a wild turkey springing from a limb , accomplishing air speed , pulling up the legs , straightening its neck , plunging amid the frozen naked branches , gliding , gliding , gliding , tipping its shoulders , using an airfoil up or down to dodge limbs , accelerating , clearing the lowest boughs , locking its spread wings , slanting and playing into the crosswind , gracefully plummeting down the ridge into the ravine , dipping its body by backpedaling , using his flaps , and putting his feet to the ground to land safely and slowly beside a three - foot stream -- possibly because he felt secure here .
samantha grabbed a rotted branch for balance .
they huddled among what used to be the top branches of a spruce pine , but now the tree lay storm - thrown .

* * * just as stephanie had observed , it was quite legless , and this it was using to its advantage , since it was nt scaling across fallen branches and tree stumps .
half - heartedly , he saw a heavy pine branch swing across and through his black opponent .
he stooped to break off a small twig from the branch of a shrub used to make the bed .
some just sat on the branches and stared at the strange vessel that passed them by on the waters .
his judiciously small fire burned low and what smoke escaped quickly became lost in the thick screen of pine branches overhead .
they went around a low hanging branch and ducked under another .
was there something rustling in the grass or hiding in the confusion of twigs and branches underneath a bush ?
and look how bright yellow the willow branches and twigs are glowing .
just ahead , ushi clambered out of the water , grabbed a long branch and held it out to them .

he emerged unharmed into the yellow grass - carpeted room , with the dark woven branches over the top .
the upper parts became branches , which continued to grow and weave around themselvesuntil where a simple lock of red hair had been there was now a bush , with shiny green leaves so dark that they were almost black .
the red branches of the bush were covered in bright blue berries , tiny and iridescent , as though fragments of the sky were trapped inside .
it landed on a bright new branch and began to peck at a berry with its sharp beak , eventually fluttering off in an opposite direction , back into the wood .
his heart was still beating a little too fast , but he strolled purposefully beneath the dark arch of the woods branches , trying not to think too much about what might be concealed in their depths .
amandie made a face at him , and then went over to where a black crow was resting on a branch near the kitchen window , begging for scraps .
and then she smiled , as the crow hopped closer on the branch .
thorns and branches caught a sandra 's wool dress , but she did n't care ; she had to win .
the next , he was pulling me inside its branches .
he reached the shelter of the woods and began to walk lightly , feeling in front of him for fallen branches and sticks ; even wet , they could break and betray his presence .
he tied the oiled cloth between two tree branches , then pulled the other end back and weighted it with logs and stones until it formed a rough lean - to that would keep out what was left of the rain while making his fire more difficult to see from the road .
all i could see was a circle of night sky , stars twinkling , a few branches waving at me from on high .
sharp branches dug into her back .
the sound of branches parting resounded in my ears ; others moved in from behind , and still i felt no fear ; if they had meant to cut me down , i would have died by then ; i waited for their leaders words before i spoke to him ; the voice behind me was a full and rumpled baritone ; it was the kind a lover has that makes the women moan ; who is this ?
the leaves had shaken all at once ; the branches bent and swayed ; the raindrops scattered to the ground ; his horse had run away ; hmmm , the deep , sonorous tone seemed like a heavy sigh ; the bard had thought he was alone in his weary plight ; ah !
we sat under the leafy branches of a tall tree whose height exceeded the palaces outer wall .
the peace of the day was broken only by the sound of the wind sighing through the tree branches above .
soundless , he melted into the shadows of overhanging branches , watching the moonkind girls approach unseen .
massive branches thrust toward the sky , as if this tree alone bore the burden of supporting its weight .
instead , i noticed as we walked through the forest no tree branches or twigs reached out to snag my hair and clothing .
thinking it originated from somewhere on my left , i pushed aside a tree branch and left the path to investigate .
the pool itself spread out in a lazy stream that meandered its way serenely under tall trees with overhanging branches , eventually disappearing into the depths of the forest .
lean branches , bony skeleton arms , slapped my face .
the path was a winding one , which made travel slow , but the wind was not gusting so much in here , and the snow fell steadily down , but softly , laying like heavy frosting on the bent branches of the trees .
a gate slammed , a garbage can lid crashed to the ground somewhere down the street , and trees shook their branches with a ferocity that frightened her .
he looked up and watched the tips bend in the sky and listened to the bristling of the branches .
he had marked the spot with a large tree branch crossing the path .
then he saw the branch and the clearing just up ahead .
... grandfather tended the fire with great care , as if each dried branch was a gift from the great spirit .
every single tree shot gracefully into the air , with branches spreading as far and wide as they did up , reaching for the sky .
their branches growing wide to block out the sun so that it would be harder to find your way through the forest .
i watched the birds flying from branch to branch overhead , wondering if one of them was the flamebird that cerena had befriended .
there was a slight breeze which caused the leaves to rustle gently and the branches to sway slightly .
the roof , which slanted towards the back of the cottage , was made of many branches which were intertwined .
you could see make out the silhouettes of different types of birds perched in branches or soaring from branch to branch as well in the darkness .

but , as we got closer , we saw that it was a door leading out to a long , wide branch .
the branch was about five or six feet wide .
it had a natural railing made of smaller branches rising out of the main branch , intertwined with vines .

when we seemed to be barely able to keep our eyes open , or our heads up , we left the branch and headed back down to our own beds .
they re out on the branch already .
dozens of different types of birds bobbed and weaved between the branches of the tower and the trees around it .
many were even flying around the porch , landing on the branches and vines that made up the railing .
birds flitted in and out of my view , spiroes hopped from branch to branch , sometimes alone , sometimes chasing each other .

* * * it took several minutes , especially with stops at windows and at the branch porch to nibble on some more bread , but we finally made it back to the bottom of the tower .
i put the arrows away , then met the other three on the branch porch for some lunch .
after lunch , i spent the rest of the day sitting on the porch drinking tea and water , watching the birds flit in and out of the vines and branches , eating insects and berries , and chasing each other around .
i thought about the tower angor created , the amazing views and how peaceful it was on the branch porch , and the bread- oh , that bread was fabulous !
we all paused as a flash of red came down from the branches above .
regent had covered it with some branches and a couple of flowers .
once we entered the woods , we had to slow a bit to maneuver around the shrubs and branches that were reaching out to grab our clothing .
the woods were fairly easy to maneuver through , even in the darkness of night and some grabbing branches , so we were able to move quickly .
carrie walked and walked , her sleeves catching on branches , her feet cut by small rocks and bits of wood .
grabbing a branch , ivy hit the lizard over the head .
ivy swung the branch , pretending the creature was a softball .
he was so close he could almost reach out and touch her from the branch upon which he was perched .
he swung down from his branch , stepped out of the shadows and stood where once the elf - maid stood .
all elves , except for the drow , slept in branch and bough , beneath star and moon .
he peered into the foliage when his eye was drawn by a moving branch and then he saw it .
they sat beneath the branches of a large birch , the three of them , awena , lord cyndeyrn and lady hywela .

night settled upon firth and the wood elf took to the branches to rest .
derfael and rhoslyn did not stir ; they remained beneath the branches of an elm , the prince curled up in his beloveds embrace .
while he wandered through the desolation of firth he came across a clearing in which an elf male and his lady comforted one another beneath the branches of an elm .
there was no response from the wood elf , just silence and the odd rustle of a leaf upon a branch .
he stepped out from the trees and moved away from the drooping branches so that he could be seen from that distance through the mist .
contented birds chirped and sang , large hares and horned deer bounded away at his passing , and colorful , miniature faerie dragons gazed at him solemnly from the safety of high branches .
they were all unnaturally contorted and had wrapped their many branches around mix , holding him immobile .
in the upper reaches of those tall trees , trunks and branches had been unnaturally bent to form a roomy seat .
with a flick of the dryad 's nimble fingers , huge tree branches bent to her will and swung in low all around and above them in an ominous display , set to pummel at her whim .
the thick tree branches creaked in closer about the troll .
the troll regarded the heavy , looming branches and then casually took a sip from his goblet .
before oriana could reply , another harpy hovered closer from her tree branch perch .
he 'd sculpted a sectional tree branch made of fitted limestone , carved to look realistic and set in a sturdy base .
on each section were protruding smaller branches with naturally - shaped holders , in which large sculpted flower heads would universally fit .
with a bouquet of burning branches , of course , she said with a laugh .
peeking between the branches , keira glanced around , searching for the large form of a beast in the wide clearing .
he saw my mother smile at the dragon , and touch him , and i can only suppose that a jealousy so fierce flared up in him , because he grabbed a branch lying on the ground and ran towards her , brandishing the branch .

up in the trees , perched on branches that reached to the sky , birds were creating a riotous din as they warned of the intruders .
the guards realizing the renowned assassin elzik , was not going to enter their custody voluntarily poised with long cumbersome grey shields pulled close to their left side with spears pointed towards elzik who s shining thin razor sharp swords pointed at the dirt covered road , which beneath its thinning crust was the scalped branch of one of the thousands of giant oaks which supported the colossal weight of the elf city .
elzik marched across the white marble floor which had gold leaf running outwards across the vast echoless hall like branches of a golden tree , reaching out from the raised golden throne which represented the tree trunk .
the broken reigns of their missing horses were still tied to the branches , but there were no signs of slaughter or pieces of the dead as if they had been carried away or eaten on the spot .

paranoia crept into the back of shinjis mind and he scanned the area to see bright green eyes hovering in the shadows of the interlocking branches of a tree .
shinji crossed the wooden bridge that stretched over a branch of the pond , near the slender body of a white crane that portrayed a divine elegance , and he walked under a shade tree as the bloom of white petals floated on the wind .

the children were a flurry of movement , darting in all directions ; hiding behind branches , atop limbs , and burying themselves in thick piles of foliage .
hundreds of feet above the earth , they jumped from branch to branch without the slightest hint of fear , as though only the tree existed , and they were oblivious to the distant earth below .
alana was nt the only one watching the spectacle ; a family of the slow - moving bolo monkeys crept down from the branches , regarding the scene with their wide , black eyes that always seemed so sleepy and sad .
the tree was a world unto itself -- a city towering to the heavens , its branches sprawling outward among the clouds .
when she first started observing the children so effortlessly fly from branch to branch alana had often wondered how it was they never fell , and how they lived at such heights without fear .

several adult elves were present , but to alanas amazement , they practically ignored the child as it stumbled from branch to branch .
alana realized it was the tree ; the branches were moving to protect him or fight at his side .
the branches hung in the air , menacing , as though they would crush her at any moment .
clearly , even in the air above , where the branches covered the sky like clouds .
numbering around ten times the amount of defenders , he thought his army of the risen ones could swarm the tree and end it at that , but to his surprise , the tree itself took up the fight , its branches moving to ensnare and smash the lumbering beings before many could even make it to the trunk .
and those that did , fell by the thousands as the protectors fired upon them with simple wooden arrows from atop the branches .
the branches came at them , too slow .
the speed of the initiated was enhanced by the virus , allowing them to easily outmaneuver the slow moving branches .
his opponent lay crumpled against a branch , his staff smoldering at his feet .

in ostedes branch - like hand was the staff of kings wood .
it took all his strength just to look up , and when he did , he saw that ostedes held the staff of kings wood in his branch - like hand .
every step he took was a battle ; roots reared up to smash him , vines to grab him , and branches to tear him apart .
as he pondered his options , he sensed the branches closing in on him once more .
he was about to risk all and continue on his path to the dead tree , when the branches suddenly stopped .
a mass of vines and branches floated in the air high above him .
luckily , the signature of his dark power was enough the wall before him collapsed in a pool of black sludge , revealing a clear pathway to a massive branch that seemed to span the heavens .
all he could see was the trunk directly below his feet , and a wall of branches at his sides .
hidden within the branches , he could barely make out several tall humanoid forms .
the only thing sprouting from his head was a thick , throbbing black branch .
a blur , he moved among the branches , inspecting every dangling elf he could find .
their misshapen forms also filled the width of the branch , making it difficult to simply step around them .
he was about to turn back the way he came when he heard a moaning coming from the branches behind the behemoths .
but imorbis simply stepped aside , grinning as the behemoth ambled off the branch of the dead tree .
meanwhile , a swarm of vines and branches moved to engulf him .
though his body and limbs were thin , he seemed deceptively massive , for each of his arms had over a hundred limbs that spread out from his body like branches .
one symbol was emblazoned on all of their foreheads a tree , its roots forming a world , its branches blazing like a sun .

estin , he said as he tied their horses ' reins to a nearby branch at the edge of the clearing .
< > < > < > it was the most frightening ride of his life with dark shadows of branches flying overhead and the forest full of predatory growls and barks .
more than once , an overhanging branch seemed to swoop in over his head until estin finally decided to hunch over his horse .
estin was very much concerned for his brother but he was too tired and too numb from exhaustion to think or argue so he set himself to tying the horses to the branch of a nearby tree .

chapter 14 light crept in through the tree branches .
all of the branches were sagging with snow .
because it was early in the season , the leaves had nt even fallen , and the excess weight was causing the branches to break .

the house seemed cold and menacing and uninhabitable , and she stared at the ceiling , certain a branch would come crashing through the plaster at any moment .
what if a branch falls on the car ?
do nt think about a tree branch plummeted to the ground in front of her , and abby cried out .
a few more branches cracked from somewhere above her .

abby kept her eyes glued to the trees , her eyes skimming the dark , snow - laden branches .
the forest creaked and swayed ; several branches shed their snow .
it was much darker here and peter had to proceed slowly , constantly scanning with his eyes and feeling his way through the stream and past the hovering branches .

now one sleeved hand held onto a branch and the other pretended to draw lines between the points in the sky .
marmel was on the edge of a forest , where he could see spots of white dotting along the outer wall of branches .
startled awake , marmel jolted from his branch .
the branch moved to steady him , but he slipped over the edge .
marmel flung his arms at the speeding branches to try and slow down , but the long sleeves that covered his hands made it impossible .
he then slammed his feet on the branches as they past .
underneath the canopy of branches , the sun flooded from the horizon .
fees and arlows covered the branches .
the beautiful and powerful ava loved to sit in the tolens branches that stretched beyond the ridges of the sky .
the leaves and branches that were gnawed and broken off would grow back with the sunlight .
the arlows then began to teeter on their branches , and one by one , tipped and fell on him .
on its right side , one large gnarled lower branch was trimmed of all leaves and twisted at the end to a knotted club .
the remains of another thumper appeared on the trees left side , with only a few new branches extending from the socket of the one - armed colossus .

nova thought she could see stripes of colour hanging from their branches .
a long red flag hung down from a branch high above her head .
nova looked at each one and saw plainly dressed people above them , leaning out from branches and watching everyone below them .
their twisting leafless branches fell into one another to create a something mangled and lifeless .
on a twisted worn branch stood an old man and two children dressed in their costumes .
they had run into thick sets of branches that combed and scratched her back and sides .
he was still trailing close behind them and was trying hard not to get stepped on by ash , or struck with any flying broken branches .
nova laughed but let out a squeal as they moved through the dry pointy branches .
these trees had their branches pruned and cut into great wide spirals that led into the upper boughs .
he heard before another crack of a branch .
their high branches were spread out to create thick cover overhead .
the stage was well lit from countless white and yellow light flowers that wrapped themselves around the overarching mesh of branches .
they had many branches that ran up their towering sides .
higher up , the branches intertwined to form seats or stands , and were covered with people .
in the middle of the tangle of branches between the tolens , sat one reclined figure holding a staff .

marmel stood up and looked through the tangle of branches of the bog .
seeing oreole disappear into the branches , marmel put it out of his mind and followed after .
marmel and oreole were silent , being careful not to slip or step on any dead branches .
oreole then slumped on the branch next to him .
feeling suddenly heavy on the branches , marmel glanced over to oreole .
turning to his bird , oreole leaned heavier on the branch in front of him .
the branch held as oreole clutched onto it .
the boys gripped motionless to the creaking branches and felt the air blown out of their lungs .
oreole finally crept to his feet and peered through the branches .
the dried and cracked branch he landed on splintered and broke beneath his feat .
marmels other hand quickly slipped from a branch covered in lichen .
thin lichen covered branches extended out over the surface in front of him .
the slender branches ran the trees height and he started to climb under the weight of his tunic .
as the man turned and saw him , marmel looked away and heaved up the final branches into the canopy overhead .
marmel stumbled and grasped through the tangle of branches as he moved quickly away .
all he could hear were the branches creak under his feet and the scrapping of his hands against the bark .
widely spaced branches circled up the trunk under the loft .
when marmel reached the first branch he breathed with relief .
one of the branches above reached down for him to hold onto .
the one he was standing on rotated forward and up while the branch in front moved backward for him to step on .
to take him around the trunk and up to the loft , he simply had to take small steps from one to the next and hold onto the branches hanging overhead .
the branch he stood on slowly rose up and he rolled inside and lay down .
he was reaching for the stiff branches underneath the loft across from him .
marmel stood down on the branch below him .
with each step he glided down as the branches moved silently underneath his feet .
marmel knew every fallen branch and half buried stone on the paths lining the village .
they fell forward as their roots and gnarled branches came down on the charging beasts .
we walked down a path under branches of willow trees to a meadow next to a pond and waterfall .

cautiously he clambered on and pushed himself out , punting along with the branch .
perched on a low branch was the same eagle that had led vincent here .
it occurred to him then that the eagle was not sitting on a low branch .
the tree branches and thorn hedges scratched and clawed at my hair and dress , and sweat trickled down my neck .
the bird , an eagle , was perched on a low tree branch just outside the palace gates .
he glanced up at the branches above and back at where we had found it .
his head snapping down as he heard a branch crack with a snick , he slowed to a stop to listen as the sound was followed then by a rustling .
he thought of simply placing a sturdy branch beneath the creature and trying to roll it , but such a thing was not likely to have good results .
it took hours , breaking the green branches from the pines , sliding them beneath the bear and bending them into hoops before binding them with vines scavenged from the forest floor .
dropping down from the branches above the orc , nearly as large as he , did the opposite of what gnak expected .
snapping a few green branches from nearby trees , he climbed into the entrance of the cave , pulling the branches with him to conceal the entrance .
snapping a few green branches from nearby trees , he climbed into the entrance of the cave , pulling the branches with him to conceal the entrance .
the branches he had dragged to the front of the cave remained , but something had alerted him into wakefulness .
carefully , so carefully , he reached up , pulling aside the leaves of the branches that covered the entrance .
without thought or plan , he wrapped his fingers about the shaft of his spear in the darkness just as the branches covering his only exit were torn asunder , a thick gray head thrusting into the hole they had concealed with a deafening roar .
nearly parallel to the ground , its great boughs swept out in all directions , including down to the soil , creating a great place to hide beneath its thickly needled branches .
then , gathering up branches that had broken free when the tree fell , they carried them into their makeshift room to create for themselves a comfortable place to lay , and better walls to keep predators at bay .
as the voices continued to discuss the subject of mutts and their views on them , the branch i was leaning against gave way and broke .
there were vines and branches that cast dark shadows all around us .

faintly i thought i could hear nearby branches rustling .
their branches were like arms which hugged me , and i did nt get many hugs in this foreign land .
i gripped the tree branch tighter , not wanting to fear .
she felt herself rolling and crashing through the bushes , gathering speed as she slid , fell and bumped down a steep slope , hitting rocks and branches .
the trees around them were tall maple and pine trees with massive trunks and high branches .
the tree trunks were burnt and the black branches had no leaves on them .
his passage was blocked by the mass of leaved branches beneath him .
the branches were sturdy enough to hold his weight , but the trees height did not give him an aerial view .
all around them were burned , leafless , black trees whose branches looked like thorns .
now , all that remained were burnt tree trunks with thorn - like branches .
he dodged a huge branch that stuck out into the path they followed .
this witch was bent over and she used a crooked tree branch to support her weight .
straining her eyes , she realized that there was a darker blot in the darkness outside the skirt of the tree branches .
the branches were close together here , and she groped with her hand behind her until she found one strong enough to bear her weight .
a crackling of branches , and she could see the coals again .
she realized that a cold sweat was running down the centre of her back and that her fingers were clenched to the branch .
feeling around , she could tell that she was sitting where two large branches joined the trunk .
if she put her back against the main stem , and leaned her arms on another branch to her left , she just might be able to get comfortable it took several long minutes of squirming around , but just as her heartbeat began to slow , she found a position that was semi - comfortable and she finally drifted off to be roused by the feeling of falling .
she jerked awake , grabbing the branch .
she was not going to get to sleep if she was afraid of falling off the branch .
she wound it around her torso , then around the branch .
again , she drifted off to a light sleep , vaguely conscious of her uncomfortable position , of the hard branches digging into her , the prickly bark under her hands .
she untied the sash and climbed down , amazed that she had made it so high through the tight branches in the dark .
soon a tiny flame appeared and he started to add larger branches .
she slid into the forest as quickly as possible , glad of her boots , trying to ignore the branches scoring her naked skin .
hoping it would be as good a shelter from prying eyes come daylight , she crawled under the long , drooping branches , wrapped herself in her blanket , dropped her head on her bundle and slipped into a restless slumber .
there was a large oak tree nearby and its leafy branches reached out wide from its huge trunk , offering a protective canopy for anything that wished to nestle below .
the trees had long , dark branches that seemed to be covered with moss .
their trunks glimmered , while their branches held hundreds of ice crystals .

as they looked on , they saw the red haired girl raise her arms up over her head just as she was obscured from view by the reaching arms of the tree branches .

the olive tree that in former years had shaded the well and provided dark , delicious fruit for their table now held only one leafy branch , the rest spindly and dried .
in the shade of that branch , callithoe made out details she had not seen before : the woman 's slumped shoulders , the tangles of wiry , gray - streaked hair , the dirt blackening her feet but leaving her slender ankles clean and white .
a branch cracked not a stadium from her .
he also saw no sign of habitation except for three sloth - like creatures hanging from tree branches on either side of him .
and so they got their wish , and rather than quickly and painlessly dissolving into the sacred river they were exiled from lurien , stripped off their robes , nude and filthy and shaking like hunted beasts , and driven through the mists and up mirror mountain and thence finally cast into a world of touch , where , thinking they could outsmart their punishers , they embraced the barks of two massive trees that stood side by side , hoping they would remain together till the end of time , their roots and branches touching in undying , nameless bliss .
so they tried to kill him , many times and in many ways , but royen could nt be killed : he would tear down the sturdy bricks behind which they had walled him in with his bare fists ; hold his breath under the water they d cast him in till he could brake the chains he was tied up with ; uproot and bring down a great oak on whose branch they had hung him and then he would slaughter those who had tried to murder him , rip them from limb to limb till their own mothers could nt tell them from the carcass of a cow devoured by wolves .
when next they looked , their four - legged friend was gone , seeking perhaps its makers but gallan and raddia did nt mind , for the clearing , with its perimeter of tall trees intertwined at the top to form a dome of thick entangled branches , seemed , if not the ideal place to spend the night , the best they could hope for under the circumstances .
but her musing was cut cruelly short , for suddenly the sky erupted in a rumble so loud it shook the ground they sat on , and moments later ether milk was pelting down on their arboreous roof , slipping through the branches gaps and falling upon them hard and fast , forcing them to flee before they were drenched to the bone .
so on that day , while they hid behind a shrub and gazed at the domicile through its branches , their fear was as deep as it was delightful .
as darkness thickened and the cold became insufferable , the girl led them to a grotto at the foot of a neabry hill , where they could pass the night in relative comofrt to which she saw at once , experienced as she was in living on her own , by lighting a fire with branches and driftwood and roasting the fish and some mussels shed gathered .
lazing around on the branch of a pine , warmed by shafts of sunlight and nibbling on blackberries or the occasional squirrel !
arguably , some of the trees looked more dead than alive , their wilted branches grazing the sand like the hands of a blind person struggling to stand up , and most of the clumps of grass that grew here and there had a withered , sickly look but nonetheless they were green and orange and yellow , and after a seeming eternity crossing a bleak world where black and grey reigned supreme , to see these distinct signs of life filled them with new hope .
oh , and how long it lasted , that awful , unspeakably awful time of hanging by a branch and praying it would withstand the violence of the wind !
iabi had retained his sight purely by chance , because in his dazzlement and the confusion of the voices that babbled with growing confidence he did nt know which way to turn , and was facing away from the stone , stumbling amongst torn branches and roots and calling his father .
but then iabis sister , a tiny bag of bones with bald patches on her egg - thin skull and the face of an old woman , stepped carefully among the lettuce , stood on the tips of her toes , and plucked a shiny purple plum from a low - hanging branch .
the branches hung down around them like a green tendriled waterfall , the rustling leaves mimicking the sound of rushing water .

they turned to find a man standing on the edge of the wood carrying a bundle of branches in his arms .
he set down the branches and walked towards the group , lowering his hood to reveal many more braided strands .
a flood of foul brown water fell from the creature , and then its twisted body came into view : a great hulk of fallen weeds and branches , an arched back of stone and rotting wood , and veins of thick brown liquid , like the roots of dark trees .
large branches were embedded in its back , as if the very trees themselves had tried to slay it , and upon one of those branches lay an impaled skeleton , a mangled frame of shattered bones and twisted limbs .

she washed their clothing in the pool and used branches from the small trees to dry them over one of the other fires .
the shadows fell thick through the trees , the wan grey light creating pools of shifting , fluid dimness between branch and bough .
he reached up , instead , using his knife to make a deep cut , scoring a branch on the nearest tree .
he broke it off and , as the others turned to watch him , put his knife away , took the heavy branch in both hands , and , from out of the lamed marat 's knife reach , methodically clubbed him to death .
fidelias tossed the branch down to one side .
a few paces past the first branches , he and the stalking bird beside him vanished .
tavi saw movement around him , in the branches and the hollows of the trees - the furies of the wood , restless as the animals before the coming storm , skittering back and forth and watching silently from the shadows .

the gargant swayed a bit to one side , even as its rider did , and the branch passed the marat by no more than the width of a finger .
they rose up , their trunks twisted and gnarled , stretching many branches each high into the air , like the reaching hands of a drowning man .
as the gargant drew closer to the edge of the precipice , tavi could see that the growth had runnels and areas that looked as though bubbles of air had been trapped beneath it , and for all the world looked like melted wax had been dripped over the surfaces of the trees , but for the desperately reaching branches high up in them , layer upon layer , until the whole resembled some fantastic , bizarre work of art .
as far as he could see , in the faint light of the glowing wax , those odd trees writhed and twisted , their branches and trunks hung in festoons and swirls of the waxy growth .
at the heart of the scene stood a single , ancient tree , barren trunk lifting high , dead branches mostly worn away by time .
a second spider - like creature sat on a low , wax - shrouded branch , on level with tavi 's head .
they erupted from everywhere , from every surface where the croach glowed , ripping their way up out of the waxy forest floor , dropping from the glowing branches of the twisted trees , boiling out of the interior of the great tree trunk itself .
one or two chirruping whistles , perhaps , echoed through the trees after him , but they were sparse , and he left them behind him , his steps light on the surface of the croach , terror lending him more speed than he would have credited to himself before that night he flicked one glance over his shoulder as he ran and saw something through the glowing trees , at the base of the monolith , the opening he 'd fled through he saw something tall , glistening - alien it stood just within the central tree , just behind the doorway tavi could not quite see it , but he could feel it in a way both horribly intimate and beyond simple description the lower - pitched whistle that went out through the trees felt , to tavi , like some sort of hideous , mocking laughter tavi fled and did not look back again he ran over the croach until his legs were burning and his limbs felt as though they would be ripped apart by the demands he placed on them he almost did n't see the strip of blanket that he had torn off and tied to a low tree branch before he left to mark his way back he headed for it , and from that flag spotted the next , and the next , laying out his escape route back to the ropes at the base of the cliff ` ` aleran ' '' came a voice from before him kitai dropped from a tree branch ahead of him ` ` do you have it ' '' ` ` got two ' '' tavi yelped ` ` could n't get any more ' '' kitai extended her hand , and tavi shoved one of the mushrooms into it ` ` run !

shrieks rose all around him , came closer , though the still - blazing branch seemed to have confused some of the keepers , to have temporarily slowed their advance .
tavi lifted his dazed head to see the first of the keepers edging past the blazing blanket and branch .
he was almost within the circle of her arms when the window to his left crashed inward and suddenly a wind - blown branch was in the room with them , autumn leaves still clinging to it .

teenie hopkins had spent a long , hot summer under those branches .
after he looked under the branches , boxleitner threw up .

right now , in november , the branches were bare , and the grass was bleached and strewn with dead leaves .
the headstone was partially obscured by the overhanging branches of a live oak , and the light was especially bad .
we drove slowly through the trees surrounding the old site , our headlights catching on the branches and trunks as we passed .
then there was a tremendous roaring above them : the ground shuddered , branches tumbling down in a rain of dry leaves and pine needles , and an immense old tree was wrenched whole out of the ground beside them : temeraire was above them , beating wildly as he tore away the cover .
i could n't walk into that room with the smoky fire from the damp branches i had scavenged at the edge of the woods after the coal had run out , my bands empty of any hope .
most of the time , i perched up in the branches of an old oak , hoping for game to come by .
any sign of danger , a distant howl , the inexplicable break of a branch , sent me flying back to the fence at first .
from the branches hang hundreds of wind chimes , which account for the tinkling i heard .
i climb up , sticking to the stronger branches close to the trunk , and find a sturdy fork for my bed .
as a precaution , i remove my belt , loop it all the way around the branch and my sleeping bag , and refasten it at my waist .
through the branches i can see the seal of the capitol , which appears to be floating in the sky .
the sound of a breaking branch wakes me .
this is not the sound of a branch under someone 's foot , but the sharp crack of one coming from a tree .
i can see an arm here , a boot there , through the breaks in the branches .
i remain in my awkward position , muscles trembling with exertion for a while longer , then hoist myself back onto my branch .
while i ' ve been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag and the willow branches , it has probably been difficult for the cameras to get a good shot of me .
i cut up the rabbit , fashion a spit out of branches , and set it over the coals .
while the rabbit cooks , i grind up part of a charred branch and set about camouflaging my orange pack .
i find a broken branch that will do for a walking stick and i start off .
burning branches crack from trees and fall in showers of sparks at my feet .
and i run , choking , my bag banging against my back , my face cut with branches that materialize from the gray haze without warning , because i know i am supposed to run .
i ' m another thirty feet in the air when i hear the crack and look down to see cato flailing as he and a branch go down .
the girl with the arrows , glimmer i hear someone call her - ugh , the names the people in district 1 give their children are so ridiculous - anyway glimmer scales the tree until the branches begin to crack under her feet and then has the good sense to stop .
in the last dim rays of light , i make her out , watching me silently from between the branches .
it looks about the size of a raccoon , but it hangs from the bottom of a branch , swaying ever so slightly .

this in itself is dangerous since the branches are becoming precariously thin even for me , but i persevere .
if i do n't get through this branch in a matter of seconds , the entire swarm could emerge and attack me .
and just as the knife cuts through , i shove the end of the branch as far away from me as i can .
it crashes down through the lower branches , snagging temporarily on a few but then twisting free until it smashes with a thud on the ground .
rue perches in a branch across from me , her hands cupping something .

along the way , i see no sign of another tribute , not a puff of breath , not a quiver of a branch .
the downpour ends and there 's only the residual drippings of water from branches , the rush of the now overflowing stream below us .
so we both strip off our boots and socks and , while there 's some improvement , i could swear he 's making an effort to snap every branch we encounter .
i begin to gather branches and brush .
she could fly , birdlike , from tree to tree , catching on to the slenderest branches .
i can see orchards in the distance , and i wonder if that 's where rue would have worked , collecting the fruit from the slimmest branches at the tops of the trees .
now , as i trudge through the snow , i see the mockingjays hopping about on branches as they pick up on other birds ' melodies , replicate them , and then transform them into something new .
her hands are occupied with steadying a rough crutch made from a broken branch .
i ' m nearing the fence when a mockingjay lights on a branch and trills at me .
i begin to skirt along the tree line , searching for a tree with a branch high and long enough to fit my needs .
the trunk is too wide and icy to shinny up , though , and there are no low branches .
i could look for another branch , but it 's almost dark now .
even if i could figure out some way to escape - maybe get a rope up to that maple tree branch and climb out - there 'd be no escaping with my family and friends now .

above us , a mat of grass suspended on branches shields our faces from the sunlight .
i run wildly in the direction of the voice , heedless of danger , ripping through vines and branches , through anything that keeps me from reaching her .
i desperately search the branches but see nothing .
it 's coming from the mouth of a small , crested black bird perched on a branch about ten feet over my head .
perching in the surrounding branches .
he has finnick secure it tightly around a broken branch and lay it on the ground .
it takes me a moment to remember the second , much shorter strand that beetee wound around a branch and left on the ground before he even began his design on the tree .

they sat well in among the branches , maneck watching him with what seemed sometimes like profound curiosity , sometimes like impatience , but was likely an emotion ramon had never felt or heard named .
in the beginning , he kept the gordita and the grasshoppers far enough back that the cooking went slowly , but as the scent of grease and cooked meat woke his own belly , he let the branch dip .
broken branches and scuffed , turned litter showed it as clearly as if he 'd left signs .
a branch or a stick had been driven into the soil at the great stone 's edge , and a rag had been tied to the top , like a banner .
the branch set just at the edge of the stone where it could amplify any vibration within the granite slab .
ramon thought he could see the branch shudder in the immeasurably brief moment before the explosion came .
the triggering branch was currently nothing more than a handful of toothpicks scattered from the meadow up toward low orbit .
he had a momentary image of a flapjack somewhere high in the air , surprised at being impaled by a length of branch , but he suppressed a chuckle .
it would have been tricky to isolate the movement of the stone from the vibrations of the branch and its flapping banner .
the branch had been set as a trigger particularly sensitive to the relatively stable stone , but anyone taking the shirt off or shifting the branch itself would have set off the charges as well .

ramon lifted the thing with a branch broken from the nearest tree .
ramon broke branches and fronds to make himself a leanto , the sahael stretching to accommodate his movements .
` ` and what is the reason for displaying the food in a tree branch ?
he spoke about none of it , only judging where best to place his feet and what angle to take around the trees in order to keep the sahael from catching on a branch and tugging at his throat .
there were fewer signs of his twin now - no footprints , few small branches broken at the correct height for a man to have done the damage .
with a deep breath , ramon pushed his blackwood lover away and stumbled to a small dam of branches that had been laced together with ivy and strips of bark .
it did n't occur to him that the mesh of branches tied together on the sandbar was odd until he heard the sharp intake of breath behind him and turned to see a surreal and familiar sight .
he 'd made a raft ; the branches out there had n't wrapped themselves with bark .
laced together with thin branches and saplings young enough to be hewn with the serrated back edge of the field knife , they would float .
` ` you go see if you can find some good branches to put between them .
the rest of the day was spent dragging fallen branches and wide iceroot leaves back to the campsite and making up the story he could tell his twin .
he tried not to wonder what had happened between maneck and the chupacabra , which of the two had lost and which was still under the roof of branches , hunting him .
by sundown , he and his twin had gathered another six sheaves and perhaps a third of the branches that they would need to make the raft floor .
ramon boiled a double handful of sug beetles and his twin roasted a cooper 's dragon - one of the small , birdlike lizards that inhabited the low branches .
then they planned for the next day - how to carry the branches and sheaves to the water for assembly , how much more would need to be harvested , whether they needed to strip more bark to use for rope .
they considered how many branches they 'd need to finish the structure .
ramon fashioned a rough harness from two cut branches and a length of bright blue panama ivy and used it to haul the cane and the branches down the short path to the water .
ramon fashioned a rough harness from two cut branches and a length of bright blue panama ivy and used it to haul the cane and the branches down the short path to the water .
lashing the branches together and binding them to the cane floats was long work , but not difficult .
ramon found himself falling into a rhythm - setting the wood in place , tying it on one side , then the other , then in the center where it crossed another branch .
at the end , they laid the iceroot leaves over the branches , tacking the broad , leathery fronds together until they were like a carpet .
then a few good branches for the fire pit .
maybe some good branches ? ''
better to worry about which knots best bound the cane to the branches of the raft .
how long did it take to pull down some leaves and find a few pinche branches ?
he had what looked like half a bushel of iceroot leaves bound to his back with ivy and an improvised stretcher of branches trailing behind him , loaded with sticks the right size for burning .
the flow of water arced at the raft 's sides , an icy wave running over the back edge and draining between the loose branches .
after a long series of gestures , ramon understood the man 's intentions : he would cast the vine out to ramon , tied around a small branch .
ramon was then to haul enough of the vine onto the raft to throw the original branch back .
the pile of firewood broke free , branches and twigs spilling into the river and bobbing away into the mist .
the structure of branches that made up the bulk of the raft had suffered , but not so badly that ramon felt moved to repair it .
it would be easy to find fallen branches and double handfuls of moss analogs to use for tinder .
he dropped the branches held in his arms , and turned to run back to the river , but he had n't made it halfway before he skidded around a stand of close - knit godsarm oaks and found the beast itself , glaring at him with what seemed like equal parts hunger and hatred .
ramon raised his arm , throwing it onto the laced branches .
if there had been some firewood , he might have been able to grab a branch and use it as a club .

he drove the blade 's tip into a branch , pinning the sahael to the wood .

the earth spoke to her , the way the sky did to me : whispers of leaves , dry creaks of branches , the padding footsteps of living things , small and large and minuscule , that made up her realm .
every stone turned its sharpest edge toward me ; every branch whipped at my body or my face .

some fifty yards from the picnic area , not far from the old train tracks , a twisted , halfuprooted tree seemed to reach in ralph 's direction , stretching branches that actually did look a little like clutching hands .
the sky was a blue lane above the road , and the oldsmobile 's shadow raced beside them , wavering across leaves and branches .
the cracks and crenellations and bulges of its gray bark seemed to make the shapes of halfburied , silently screaming faces , and the tree spread its nude branches against the sky like grim ideograms ... ones which boreat least in ralph 's imagination - an uncomfortable resemblance to the japanese ideograms which meant kamikaze .
chuckle engstrom liked to hide behind the tree in his front yard with a long tree - branch which he called his peekle wand .
` ` please ... do n't do that again ... . '' i hurried off blindly , into the forest , ignoring the branches and leaves whipping against me .

lanterns were hung on all its branches .
there were green trees with trunks of dark smoke : their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment , and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbits , disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces .
not far from the road - meeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree : it was still alive and had leaves on the small branches that it had put out round the broken stumps of its long - fallen limbs ; but it was hollow , and could be entered by a great crack on the side away from the road .
the west wind was sighing in the branches .
he was lying in a bower made by a living tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground ; his bed was of fern and grass , deep and soft and strangely fragrant .
occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch , or stick a root out , or grasp at you with a long trailer .
i thought all the trees were whispering to each other , passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language ; and the branches swayed and groped without any wind .
for the moment there was no whispering or movement among the branches ; but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being watched with disapproval , deepening to dislike and even enmity .
just behind them a large branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash into the path .
the air was thick with them , fluttering yellow from the branches ; for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the valley , and the reeds were rustling , and the willow - boughs were creaking .
at last they came suddenly into a thin shade ; great grey branches reached across the path .
enormous it looked , its sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many long - fingered hands , its knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs moved .
a hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches ; the leaves rustled and whispered , but with a sound now of faint and far - off laughter .
the branches of the willow began to sway violently .
there was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about , as though they had dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of the river - valley and set up ripples of anger that ran out over the whole forest .
the leaves hung silently again on stiff branches .
i 'll sing a wind up and blow leaf and branch away .
tom sprang away , and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of the willow with it .

the sun was now high , and it shone down through the half - stripped branches of the trees , and lit the clearing with bright patches of light .

the wind murmured in the branches of the trees .
taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches .
it may have been that the dancing shadows tricked their eyes , but certainly to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be bending this way and that so as to come above the flames , while the upper branches were stooping down ; the brown leaves now stood out stiff , and rubbed together like many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth .
he led the way in under the huge branches of the trees .
nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at its edge , and one old stump of a tree with only two bent branches left : it looked almost like the figure of some gnarled old man , standing there , blinking in the morning - light .
many of the trees seemed asleep , or as unaware of him as of any other creature that merely passed by ; but some quivered , and some raised up their branches above his head as he approached .

she propped herself up by a large bough that stretched approximately forty feet out from the main trunk at waist level before it reached the ground and from there projected itself up again , spreading out into the vast canopy of branches and leaves .

he needed a place to rest , and set about constructing a lean - to from branches , leaves , and moss .
i was about to retort with reason when the image of the branches slowly sinking to the ground then embracing him returned , and i could find no reason within me not to believe him .

in this hasty motion , his foot scraped against a branch and his crossbow bumped against the tree .
just to show off , he leapt into the air , landing on the branch of a tree and leapt from it even higher into a grand arch above the trees .
they both turned in the direction of vallaya and tried to pierce their sight through the darkness and forest , but all they could see was the swaying of branches in the wind and the glistening of the moonlight reflected on the flickering leaves .

even if there had been light , from either the stars or the moon on this dark night , it would not have found its way to the ground or to the man as he walked , as the confabulation of leaves and branches would have conspired to prevent a single rays passage .
off in the distance behind him , the man heard a crash as a large branch hit the leaf - littered floor of the woods .
there , at the edge of the tree line , two large sycamore trees had grown past each other at an angle , their branches intertwining and pulling them toward each other .
he picked up a fallen branch and began to brandish it like the staff of moses .
tobey walked at the head of the group , using his staff to clear branches and leaves out of the way of the trail .
bryan and tobey emerged first and began to scour the area near the tree line with their flashlights , looking for fallen branches to put on the fire .
the dry tinder and branches caught , and soon there was a crackling blaze in the fire pit .
tobey asked , grabbing one of the machetes from the branch they had left it embedded in the night before .
the leafy canopy of the forest scattered the sunlight , which only arrived on the ground in slits and broken shafts , the shadows on the brown floor waving in time to their progenitors still attached to the branches above .
finally , he selected a direction and forged ahead through undergrowth and fallen branches , off of any recognizable trail .
they had grown into a rough horseshoe shape , their branches intertwining to form a thick , dense , wall of foliage .

jamie looked through the small gaps in the walls of branches and tried to ascertain whether the sun was shining .
behind him , a hidden door built of branches , which had blended in with the rest of the enclosure , opened .
she heard scurrying behind her and turned to see a small squirrel poke its head under the branches .
he looked up through a tangle of branches and saw that it was night .
even through the thick thatch of branches , he could see flickering , as if everything outside the hideaway was burning .
he tossed the head into the branches of the enclosure and turned away with a dismissive shrug .
she looked over at him and saw that his head had been sheared off by a tree branch that was embedded in the back of the headrest .
a strong gust of wind rustled the top branches and leaves of the trees .
he hung suspended from a sturdy oak branch a few yards away , and once in a while he deigned to comment .
tree branches slapped his face and drew blood .
a path of broken branches and a skid mark on the ground showed where he had rocketed in .
tom followed the sounds , pushing aside leaves and branches until he broke through into a clearing .
the place he had entered the clearing from was now a mass of intertwined vines and branches , shrubs and saplings so thick he could nt step through .
the branches were twisted , intertwined in their own kind of battle , the wood so weathered it looked like human sinew .
his left hand had a death grip on a branch .
for a moment tom thought he would be swept under the tree by the current but he scrabbled his way through the branches , the loose handcuff swinging on one wrist .
stars peeped through the branches .
inside his mind he watched as the branches stretched upward into the future .
the moment , this moment , was the trunk where he stood and any choice by any man , woman or child was a new limb that divided again and again with each choice , rising higher until the branches were lost in a tangle overhead .
his mind traveled into the branches .
he felt vibration as it grew taller with every moment , spreading its branches , filling the extents of his vision .
the branches glowed like a billion lights , .
among the branches were the paths that led to any outcome he needed , all he had to do was find them .
he traveled up into the tree , higher into the branches , into the future but as he did , a gray mist appeared , growing thicker .
soon it was difficult to make out the branches , the choices , the results .
tom could still make out the branches but there was something new .
it filled the sky , blocking any sight of the branches above .
but the most alarming thing was the way it bent the tree , binding the branches to a single point .
the dark arc in the tree had gathered the branches to a single point , a point just ahead in time .
i could hear the rustling of leaves and branches , the movement of tiny creatures through the fallen leaves .
a branch drew blood on her face with an almost personal slap .
the branch had hurt , and there were tears in her eyes as she stopped , but she was fascinated by the blood .
she ran through the trees , and the branches slashed at her face .
it was a quiet day , and the shifting of branches in the forest caught her ear .
she had yet to reach the center , the place where the branches in their overflowing eagerness had blotted out the sun .
she stepped over , she ducked under , she pulled the interwoven branches out of the holes they had made in her shirt .
here the tree branches had woven together , tied themselves around each other like worms in a bucket .
even though the branches were now very thick , even though they communed together with a perverse intimacy that seemed not to want her to pass through .
she had just forced her way through a thick nest of branches , and the pine sap coating her fingers made her think queasily of marinated chicken .
there were bits of broken pine branch tangled in her hair .
the branches in front of her seemed almost impenetrable , and the branches to either side were stuck together like clasping fingers .
the branches in front of her seemed almost impenetrable , and the branches to either side were stuck together like clasping fingers .
the branches were woven too tight , and too thick with pitch .
the branches were n't spider webs ; of course not .
she stooped low , almost down on her knees , and under the lowest branches .
she scraped her face and her arms till they were marked by bloody signatures , but she found her way through to the other side of the branches .
there were still more branches , an entire world of them .
the gray chaos of branches made her progress slow , and the smell of the pine was sharp and sweet , cloying as a love letter .
she dove at the branches like a horse bursting out of its turnstile .
was that something stuck up there , between the branches ?
she could get through the branches , with considerable effort , but it would n't matter if she did .
she 'd fight her way free of the branches till she reached the interstate .
she leaned back for just a moment against the pine branches , no longer groping her but rather holding her .
i ran along the dirt trail , stumbling over fallen branches and rocks .
the scene depicted a small pond , littered with dead trees and numerous branches .
they made strands of popcorn and wrapped them around the pine branches , only to remove them days later because all they could smell throughout the house was popcorn .
she could see the ornaments and colorful lights and the stack of presents with pretty bows and ribbons , tucked neatly beneath the lowest branches .
when she looked out jeans window , she saw a bird singing on a tree branch .
thick , gnarled vines hung from the trees like serpents and he could hear the wind drifting through the branches like a thousand ghosts getting on .
its demarcation line was less than thirty yards away and the heavy branches shifted oddly in the ghostly light .
it had not eaten in two months and had made its slow , laborious way into the lower branches of the deciduous tree , coiling its massive thirty foot length loosely around a branch while waiting for the next hapless passer - by .

he had noticed the broken branches and narrow trail on the way to the campsite , and figured they would catch up to the chimpanzee group early the following day .
deeper black separated gradually to take on blurred and preternatural shapes of branches and ground cover .
another noise off to the left ... the wet popping of a branch turgid with water .
he very much wanted to pull his feet out of the mud ; he had a clear picture of a huge , coiled snake sliding over damp branches , suspended among the trees , frederick 's smell catching on the flicking tongue and calling it silently on .
he ducked underneath a huge , hanging branch and checked his coordinates on the compass again .
a branch , somewhere above , groaned and a trickle of leaves swirled down as frederick let go of the slick body .
he made his way over and discovered he was right , the water was no higher than his ankles , and he hung his backpack on what looked to be a fairly stout branch .
he hung his shirt from the same branch and was suddenly comfortably naked for the first time in what seemed like months .
off to the left , thankfully , away from the place where his clothes and backpack swayed gently from the branch .
he peeled his shirt from the branch and pulled it on quickly .
he pushed to his feet with a great heave , a branch catching his backpack and pulling it down his backs .
even the largest , most high - powered bullet will be deflected off in a random direction if it hits a small branch or twig .
back in bed , i got used to the sound of the window being scratched by nearby branches .
wildflowers grew thick in little clusters , and the wind whistled as it came through the interlocking branches of the nearest spruces .
the wind ruffled the branches of the trees , which clicked against one another like the sound of bones rattling .
he looked startled as he saw the branch lying over the hole .
after retching up his breakfast and arming himself with a stout red oak branch , he managed to stumble to the summit of the small rise .
and then nothing till june of 1965 when a farm truck was found planted into the side of a gigantic live oak near the newly - paved highway 27 , the four passengers in its bed tossed into oblivion , the driver impaled through the throat by a branch , his passenger , the only survivor , broken - backed and babbling incessantly about things in the road .
the bridge spanned a creek , now just a dribble of water wandering in and out between rocks , broken trees and branches , and muddy cut - backs .
jesus , she whispered , eyeing the broken bicycle tied up among the weeds and split branches in a little cleft beneath the bridge .
he d been the youngest in the group that day and one of the older boys had dared him to hit it with a tree branch .

because even though jester never looked back he could hear mud slapping on the trail and breaking branches over his shoulder , a heavy rancid breathing he could not break free of .
the lowest branches were higher than the roof and now she realized the whipping shadows cast across the window were what had actually drawn her attention .
jester heard branches snapping and the heavy sound of something pushing through the bank of hedges over there and cried out from the pain in his foot again .
the thought set to break her mood and she smiled , glancing up into its tangled branches .
whatever it was had torn the dog to bits ; even its skull had been in two pieces , the bottom jaw hanging from a low - lying branch almost twenty feet away from the rest of it .
she heard the grating slash of branches passing along her passenger side from a bush growing too close to the road , at the same time sensing the cars taillights shed almost hit blink to life .
he found a stout branch at his feet and picked it up , determined to bludgeon his way through .
engaging the engine and backing pell mell down that twisting sonofabitch , branches flopping and scratching overhead and along the side panels as he got out .
everything in his primitive mind screaming to shoot , just to start firing and getting the fuck out of there , but his cop - instincts overruling the reptilian as he held his ground , feeling the skeletal poke of branches along his spine .
ned stopped and looked down at the thick piece of branch he carried in his right hand .
ned though was on a high after just getting his end away for the second time tonight , he rested the four foot piece of branch over his right shoulder and sensed the tension that gripped at the girls heart .
the branch he had planned to use to sort the horror out with was dropped to the ground as his arms hung helplessly limp by his sides .
but she had sacrificed herself to save him , picking up the branch he had dropped and swinging it towards the things head with all the force she could muster .
i can see the trees on the horizon sway , and i can even hear their branches and trunks snap , but ca nt make out the form of a beast .
he slipped past the first palm branch and disappeared into the thick tropical shrubbery .
the thick branches of the various plants and trees form thick symbiotic knots around one another .
i have to climb through overgrown branches and coiled up vegetation just to make any ground .
i know what is in the jungle , hiding , and to add to it i keep snagging my shoulders and chest on knotted branches and twisted trees that i do nt even see .
the physical exertion of pulling my weight over branches and squeezing through tight winding trees saps the power from my already tired muscles .
i decide to take a saw to the branch he is sat on .
my body brushes past some moist leaves and i battle a few sharp stabbing branches to descent into the darkness of the jungle .
the odd spider or two , dinner tray sized each of them , and a few snakes coiled around the branches above our heads .
it bursts out from the jungle cover , sending logs and branches flying as though they were mere twigs , and makes a b - line right for us !
he glances at me and then pushes past the first branch that leads us once more into the dense jungle .
up above the tree was sleeping a known person , gokus one leg was on the branch while the other one was still resting in the air , sometimes moving forward and else backward , we both looked at each other in astonishment , was he still sleeping or what , yes , he was sleeping in a very satisfied manner as if on a bed , with pillows under his neck .
our whole day went on very nicely , we were already so famous , sorry infamous that we did n't have to introduce ourselves , that night we managed to have a good sleep in the graveyard because now we were having a perfect option for goku to sleep on the branches , but we make it a little bit easy for him by placing a cloth on it , and the next morning also we , reach there on time , that abnormal grave was not given any importance by me , our problems were solved and now the things were going easily , but until goku was with us , how the ultimate peace can be achieved , two days after the starting of our classes , in the first period only , something happened which was not at all admired , when we entered the class mr yaseen was not there , we three sat together , and then a boy came with long hair , he was white , white as an indian , he was quite smart , the girls who were earlier busy in some gossiping were now looking at him with pointed eyes , he gave a jerk to his head , due to which his hair moved forward .
` ` but the things were all fine there we did n't feel any thing different and rather goku slept on the tree branches , everything was fine '' farhan said .
valefar horreat , she said as she crawled into the tunnel branch .
his massive arm surrounded me like a tree , then it pulled me to him with its branches .
more branches scratch at my face and eyes .
their branches looked like witches arms , craggy , and bent at odd angles .
leaves stirred into mini twisters , trees bent and snapped back and forth , their branches helpless and flailing .
she thought for a while about trying to climb down to the ground but could see that the branches and twigs were too densely interwoven for her to get through .
then she carefully cut a route just large enough for her to pass through the dense branches .
it was hard work at first , trying to stay balanced and saw at the same time , but her work became easier as she approached the lower levels of the branches .
she had worked all through the short summer night , her hair had been pulled and her face scratched by the hundreds of little branches , her fingers were sore and dirty , and yet she felt elated .
ignoring her tiredness she uncoiled the rope and wrapped it around the branch she was sitting on , without pausing to test it she dropped off the branch and slid down the rope , she was too tired to hang on and fell most of the way to the ground burning her palms on the coarse rope , her feet touched ground first , closely followed by her bottom , for a few seconds she lay on the grass on her back staring upwards at the tree .

at five minutes to midnight he stood waiting under the dark overhanging branches of an ancient willow tree waiting , hoping , for another glimpse of his midnight orchid .
this night was cold and clear , lit by a bright half moon , he took up his hiding place under the curtain of willow branches and waited , it was nearly an hour before cairo appeared on the window balcony above the tree , she was wearing her white sleeping gown and had tied back her long dark with blue ribbons .
richard peered dubiously over the parapet and gingerly lowered himself to the branch .
at the heart of the tree , near to the trunk , cairo had hollowed out a kind of den ; she made richard sit down on a polished branch then sat facing him .
from his hideaway in the branches mr underhill had seen everything , and at the sight of the dogs he exploded from cover and raced to cairo , arriving a second before the slavering beasts , pushing cairo behind him .
richard could hardly believe that he had to barter for a drink of water but it seemed like there was no alternative , he wandered off the road into the trees picking up twigs and fallen branches .
it was a kind of open - ended tent woven out of slender branches that when positioned around the fire would protect it from the rain and excessive winds but would also allow it enough air for it to burn properly .
in his hiding place across the lawn , beneath the slender willow branches , mr underhill braced himself , his fists clenched tight .
he got menacing clouds , the rush hour crowd , the blare of traffic and recent rain dripping from the bare branches of iron - corseted trees set at regular intervals alongside the curb .
she pulled the hood over her head and fought her way down the cement lane that ran before buildings c and d , past ash cans and prone christmas trees with shreds of tinsel still in the yellowing branches .

not much really , at first i thought it musta been a squirrel moving around in the middle branches of a birch , but a big one .
through the belt of trees beyond the brook shone a strange red light , the trunks and branches of the trees making a black lacework against it .
i turned to look for the stalk , and i found it immediately under the bush , freshly broken , between the two other roses which remained on the branch .
the light fell on to the trees , the branches , and the leaves , and a shiver of fear pervaded them also !
for the wind sends waves rising and falling over the whole surface , waves of leaves instead of waves of water , green swells like the sea , too , until the branches turn and lift , and then silvery white as their underside turns to the sun .
but the bewildering character of the islands made landing difficult ; the swirling flood carried us in shore and then swept us out again ; the willow branches tore our hands as we seized them to stop the canoe , and we pulled many a yard of sandy bank into the water before at length we shot with a great sideways blow from the wind into a backwater and managed to beach the bows in a cloud of spray .
willow bushes drop no branches , and driftwood was our only source of supply .
i added something about the difficulty of finding wood , in order to explain my absence , but the wind caught my words and flung them across the river , so that he did not hear , but just looked at me through the branches , nodding his head .
the flap of the tent door was up , and i saw the branches and the stars and the white moonlight .
it was incredible , surely , but there , opposite and slightly above me , were shapes of some indeterminate sort among the willows , and as the branches swayed in the wind they seemed to group themselves about these shapes , forming a series of monstrous outlines that shifted rapidly beneath the moon .
they first became properly visible , these huge figures , just within the tops of the bushes -- immense , bronze - colored , moving , and wholly independent of the swaying of the branches .
certainly they were not merely the moving tracery of the branches against the moonlight .
for a long time i thought they must every moment disappear and resolve themselves into the movements of the branches and prove to be an optical illusion .
the moonlight and the branches combined to work out these pictures upon the mirror of my imagination , and for some reason i projected them outwards and made them appear objective .
still half caught by the other branches , it would fall with the next gust and crush us , and meanwhile its leaves brushed and tapped upon the tight canvas surface of the tent .
masses of driftwood swept near our shores sometimes , and we fished for them with long willow branches .
we were grubbing away in the middle of a thickish clump of willows where some driftwood from a former flood had caught high among the branches , when my body was seized in a grip that made me half drop upon the sand .
i gave one terrified glance , which just enabled me to see that the shadowy form was swinging towards us through the bushes , and then i collapsed backwards with a crash into the branches .
i only know that at a later date , how long or short is impossible to say , i found myself scrambling up out of the slippery network of willow branches , and saw my companion standing in front of me holding out a hand to assist me .
i plunged among the bushes , tripping headlong , tumbling over roots , and scraping my face as i tore this way and that among the preventing branches .

the ground shook as though thousands of horses thundered across it ; and this time the storm bore on its icy wings , not snow , but great hailstones which drove with such violence that they might have come from the thongs of balearic slingers -- hailstones that beat down leaf and branch and made the shelter of the cypresses of no more avail than though their stems were standing corn .
the beds were , i thought , all empty , and the room itself without anyone but myself in it ; and i , after looking about me for some time , and admiring especially an iron candlestick with two branches , which i should certainly know again , crept under one of the beds to reach the window ; but as i got from under the bed , i heard someone crying ; and looking up , while i was still upon my knees , i saw youmost assuredly youas i see you now ; a beautiful young lady , with golden hair and large blue eyes , and lipsyour lipsyou as you are here .
an intermittent breeze was blowing and the long hanging branches of the willow would sweep to one side and then fall back again .

her long white gown rustled with the breeze and i noticed that its movements matched those of the willow 's branches .
i gently ran my fingers up and down its slender , tendril - like branches , letting its thin leaves slide across the tips .
a secret it kept hidden within its long flowing branches and deep roots .
the driving rain , the lightning and the way the wind was whipping the willow branches around held me captive .
her white lace gown flowing around her , much like the branches of the willow flowed around it in the storm .
the branches slashed at me , ripping open my flesh and when i tried to fight back , they entwined themselves around my wrists .
the fact that there was no breeze tonight was evidenced by the willow 's branches hanging down , absolutely still .
we sailed through the air , bouncing off tree trunks and through bushes and branches .
pushing myself upward with all my strength , we lifted off and shot straight up through the overhanging branches .
here and there , gnarled twisted trees stood with branches reaching sideways like black skeletal hands .

the oneirophage dreamed of orchards whose trees bore living heads on their branches .

it was through this scaly , sentient , living integument that the branches of the forest suddenly reached upwards , and the branches were made not of wood , but of flesh , with fingers and phalluses for twigs , and mouths and vaginas for knotholes .
the murderous maws of scythetooth and war mantis amputated branches left and right , ripping them from their trunks and tossing their dismembered remnants high into the air .
every time its living branches were severed or destroyed , the forest of flesh , like a hydra , immediately regenerated longer , more powerful limbs in greater numbers .
the omnibeast roared and fought madly , but was finally swallowed up by the forest of flesh and bound tightly by the countless prehensile appendages which formed its branches .
after mere minutes , the omnibeast hung like a corpse from a gallows in the viselike living branches , suspended in mid - air over the visceral forest floor .
some of the trees began quivering in fear , their skinlike bark growing sweaty and runneling with perspiration , their branches submissively pulling away from the necrodelic as he trod in their direction .
the undersides of living branches often bore breasts and testicles like fruit , and vaginas which served as lairs for two - headed arboreal creatures .
he tugged on the black cord coiled beneath the flesh of his hand , wrist , and forearm , then swung the five - pointed grapnel over his head and lodged it in one of the branches miles above .
alighting silently upon the large branch , chariah slid the grappling hook back into the open sections of skin on his palm .
chariah filled the sable dragon pipe with the skin , flesh , and blood of the sentient trees , ripping chunks of flesh right out of the trunks and branches around him , and opening gaping wounds overhead so that he could catch the dripping blood with the pipe .
the necrodelic then seated himself in the black lotus position upon the base of the branch , his spine against its trunk .
over , under , and around the thick limbs the siamese twin griffins flew , deftly navigating the gauntlet of flesh - colored branches and tree trunks .
in its trance , chariah perched invisibly amongst the branches , his grapnel ready , his crimson eyes glowing , his dark flesh completely camouflaged by the consuming nocturnal pitch , a shadow lying in wait , a predator hungry for prey , a sniper zeroing in on the raw stuff of murder itself .
the necrodelic dropped silently through the branches until he was level with the approaching griffins .
the griffins flew onward with an empty saddle as the tantradox flipped over in mid - air and plummeted to the ground , bouncing and tumbling off tree branches all the way to the swampy forest floor .
chariah caught the spinning grapnel in the flesh of his palm with a small spattering of scarlet , crouched , and then jumped from branch to branch as the tantradox fell .
chariah caught the spinning grapnel in the flesh of his palm with a small spattering of scarlet , crouched , and then jumped from branch to branch as the tantradox fell .
chariah perched upon a branch several hundred feet above them , looming over his fallen prey .
when it realized what was happening , it screamed and stumbled through the boiling water , eventually dropping the battle axe into the bubbling currents and climbing out of the steaming swamp to take refuge in the branches above , where the necrodelic was already lurking , having escaped the scalding marsh with his grappling hook before it could have any effect upon him .
the tantradox stood upon a thick branch and examined its wounds .
the tantradox struggled to keep its balance , at one point leaning face - down over the edge of the branch .
as he escaped , he noticed that the tantradox had retreated deeper into the forest of flesh , and the forest of flesh itself was fleeing the fire on burning legs , transforming and rearranging itself so that it could run along its own living trunks and branches to a safe haven .
lurking high amongst the branches , hidden in the shadows , smoking a concoction of cocaine and opium from a hookah as they leaned against the sanctuary of a thick tree trunk and contemplated the karmic implications of their role reversals , drelrei and junisia watched with drug - heightened vision and fascination as the necrodelic hunted with demonspeed , covering the miles of distance between them in moments .
as the ebon demon neared , the tantradox leapt straight up and caught an overhanging branch in its clawed and cloven hands , from which it then hung with arms outstretched , as still as siamese twin vampire bats .
when chariah passed into their boundaries , their circle , their orbit , the tantradox twisted its conjoined bodies violently in the air , one swift , savage , spinning attack that shook the branch from which it dangled .
chariah ricocheted from branches and tree trunks as he hurtled deeper into the forest of flesh , raising indigo bruises on his sable flesh and scraping his skin with deep crimson scratches .
finally , the adamantium coils became tangled and knotted , and the dazed and wounded demon was left dangling loosely from a tree branch like a corpse from a noose , twisting in the breeze .
a severed artery in the branch began spurting blood in bright red arches across the forest .
slowly , they dragged the limp form of the necrodelic back through the trees , jerking the line when necessary , bouncing his body from branch to branch .
slowly , they dragged the limp form of the necrodelic back through the trees , jerking the line when necessary , bouncing his body from branch to branch .
when the necrodelic had been retrieved , the tantradox used the death addict 's own rappelling wire to string him up , binding his wrists and ankles together with the coils and , thusly bound , to a pair of parallel branches , stretching his prostrate body tautly between the two , doubly hanging him upon a siamese twin gallows .
the tantradox stumbled drunkenly along the branch , hoping desperately to cling to the bloodsoaked skin of the tree with cloven hooves ill fit for such feats of balance and dexterity .
somehow , the siamese twins managed to keep from falling and finally regained enough control over their own muscles to reach out and grab hold of the necrodelic , who hung unconsciously between the branches above .
this time , the tantradox lost all control over its clutching fingers and tightly fisted hands , releasing their grip on the necrodelic and falling backwards from the tree branch , a burning pentagram blazing in their flesh .
the sigils of smoke rose high amongst the treetops and wafted into the necrodelic 's charred lungs , giving him the power to rip free of his bonds and drop silently to the ensanguined branch below .
severing limbs , chariah ascended in circles around the living trunks and branches , swimming a violent gauntlet to the surface .
nooses closed around any part of their bodies , leaving them suspended in mid - air between trees and chariot , stretching them like torture racks before the branches broke , releasing them to tumble awkwardly to the ground .
the oneirophage wrapped the corpse of the constrictress around the branch of a weeping willow , his other hand twining itself with a knot of inkvine , as the vacuum of space threatened to suck him into its void .
hydraman , facing similar jeopardy , had held on by biting the branches and vines above , unhinging his jaws like those of boa constrictors , and clenching his mouths around them , so that he dangled by his nine dragonheads , suspended in space .
hydraman released his nine mouths from the various branches , vines , and fronds that he had clamped onto and fell into the serpentopolis , where he quickly took refuge inside the coiling labyrinthine city .
ascending the cliffs of caine , the oneirophage found two albino soulmates dangling from the branches while joined in the sexual yin - yang position , forever welded in simultaneous fellacio and cunnilingus .
the cocaine demons had rigged up an elaborate system of coca ingestion , with the twigs , vines and roots of the surrounding plants inserted into their nostrils and the veins in the insides of their elbows , feeding them cocaine intravenously while holding them aloft in the branches above the ground as they made love .
the bone - white addicts had strung themselves up by the branches of coca trees and given themselves a continuous supply of cocaine , a perpetual state of stimulation that had lasted for years .
several of the geryon baal'striga 's breasts were severed in the process , and when the avian fertility demoness smashed through the integument on the far side of the living forest , she left in her wake several embryoes , fetuses and hatchlings quivering and dying on the swampy ground , or impaled upon twigs and branches .
chariah watched the forest of flesh burn through one of the omnibeast 's sentient scrying tubes , and saw that as the branches and trees crackled and fell to the ground they reassumed their original bodies , covering the ashen floor of the forest with a mass grave of demon corpses .
there were branches down all over the place .
of course the sensation of branches , occasional leaves and anything else touching her on the ground were believed to be the snake coming to get her .
nodding in understanding , sven picked up a branch and waved it at bob .

chapter 84 milt heard a fluttering , and he looked up to see four little birds alight on the branch above him .
milt decided to throw something at the branch , and not having anything suitable within reach , he would have to climb down from the hood of the car to find a throwing object .
they were coming through the patches of trees , bumping into trunks and limbs , completely non - reactive to the branches that stuck them in the face and tore at their clothes .
chapter 101 the vegan watched in disbelief as the carnivorous mansvenran back toward the woods , toward the throng of approaching ghouls whose arms were so gnarled that they were barely distinguishable from the branches in the darkness .
tiny branches scratched my legs and my back as i shimmied my way down into the tunnel .
he had a pocket knife and was whittling a tree branch .
he whittled off the spear - like edge he was putting on the tree branch and cursed the mistake .
he stood up , his tree branch honed to a fine edge , and walked over to her .
the sun still shone brightly through the cave entrance , and she told herself that he had probably just stepped outside to find another branch to whittle .
he nodded , held up his pocket knife and sharpened tree branch .
` ` with a tree branch ? ''

he felt tree branches and leaves and dirt and moss ( i ca n't see them ) and his knife .
he moved through the night ravine quickly , pushing aside branches that tried to slow him .
he had meticulously whittled dozens of branches to similar sizes , taken and glued them together with the sap from a group of trees on the island .
he 'd glued the rope to the finely whittled branches and had created a very primitive raft , one which he 'd built with the use of only two tools : a knife and bare hands .
i worked on the branches by day and glued them by night .
i kept the raft hidden here , covered by shrubs and branches . ''
it had a wooden table made out of tree branches and several tree stump seats .

with a tree branch ?
he looked through the window and noticed a large oak tree with a branch that overhung the garage , which was attached to the lower portion of the roof that sloped upwards to the room he now stood in .
the trees blurred by as i juked and weaved around them and popped over fallen branches and small gatherings of dry leaves .
across from me , a blazing red cardinal jumped from a tree branch and turned hard right downstream , its wings beating furiously against the air .
he stared out the window behind her and at the branches on the tree , wondering how to string some sort of sense into a stream of stories that intersected crazily and in ways he was n't sure he believed connected .
considering we only need an upper branch capable of supporting that kind of weight , we should be able to set some of these up in pretty strategic locations .
using a small weight initially , we tossed the line over a heavy tree branch near the most likely courses of access to my property .
many of the tree branches were nt heavy enough to support the weight , but eventually , we located enough strategically located trees to get the job done .
once the line was over the branches , we tied two of the 20 lb weights to each one , and pulled the weights up about 10 feet .
once in the air , the natural friction created between the cord and the branch itself made it easier than i would have thought to hold it up there .
the whole process took us over four hours , because all the branches were at different heights , and one design would nt work .
a snapping , crackling sound , the sound of a tree branch rustling .
* * * * * as we ducked under the low - hanging branches , we scanned the line of traps .
the gentle end of summer breeze kept the oak tree branches scraping at the window like bony fingers .
i could nt see through the branches to know if it was raining or if it was still the dew from the night before .
i d have to ask dad about getting someone to trim some of the branches so i could at least see the ground below .
that part of the yard held only ragged patches of grass with the branches of rose bushes blocking paths here and there .

lightening hit the tree out front and one of the branches came through your window .
todd had his first wet - dream on the last night of april , and awoke to the sound of rain whispering secretly through the leaves and branches of the tree outside his window .
a branch jutting off at an angle made a nice rest for the barrel .
it 's just a muddy hole , covered with the remains of branches and leaves .
lowering my arms , i realise the arms were just branches of a couple of neighbouring trees .
in the background - one of those detailed touches for which clay riddell might have become famous in a world where the pulse never happened - a single terrified crow is lifting off from a pine branch .
outside , a night wind tapped a branch softly against the side of the house , and far away , downtown , i heard some kid 's rod peeling rubber - it made a sound in the night like an hysterical woman 's desperate laughter .
and if you scraped the edge of a coin or the side of your pencil over it , a picture would gradually emerge out of the white - the dove bringing the olive branch back to noah , the walls of jericho tumbling down , good miracle stuff like that .
whoever was out there had jumped aside , but lebay had thrown christine into reverse , working the gear lever with black rotting fingers - a wedding ring hung on one , as loose as a hoop thrown over the branch of a dead tree - and then he threw it back into drive as the figure raced for the far side of the street .

but ellie had fallen on the stairs and kirsten had plunged down them , her eyes wide open , full of shocked surprise , ralph did n't think she 'd known what was happening , and if he could hold onto anything he would hold onto that , that it had all happened too fast for her to have any real idea , and then she had hit , she had cartwheeled , feet flying first upward and then backward , and there had been this sound , this awful sound like a branch breaking under a weight of ice , and suddenly everything about her had changed , he had seen the change even before she came to a stop at the foot of the stairs , as if that were no little girl down there but a stuffed dummy , headpiece full of straw .
at the east edge of the clearing was an oak with two thick branches spreading out in a v about twenty feet up .
in this fashion he waited for an unknown length of time , hearing the distant voices of the home - going children , aware of shifting red and black shapes on the insides of his eyelids as the breeze moved the branches above him and dapples of sun - light slipped back and forth on his face .
he grabbed a branch to steady himself , and as he was doing this , the voice did speak again .
david listened , head cocked , still holding the branch , still feeling his muscles tingle crazily as the blood worked its way back into them .
there was a tumbleweed caught in the recessed doorway , its skeletal branches rattling .
most of the maple 's leaves had fallen , and he had a good , if not perfect , sightline through the interlacing branches .
for one moment he saw the buck clearly at the end of the tunnel made by the interlocking branches - as clearly as he had seen any of the previous sixteen deer ( six bucks , ten does ) he had brought down over the years at hole in the wall .
the hat brought everything into horrible oh - god focus : the brown he had mistaken for a buck 's head was the front of a man 's wool jacket , the black jeweler 's velvet of the buck 's eye was a button , and the antlers were only more branches - branches belonging to the very tree in which he was standing .
the hat brought everything into horrible oh - god focus : the brown he had mistaken for a buck 's head was the front of a man 's wool jacket , the black jeweler 's velvet of the buck 's eye was a button , and the antlers were only more branches - branches belonging to the very tree in which he was standing .
without his rifle , he was more defenseless than the squirrel he 'd seen scurrying around the buck 's feet - if noticed by a bear , the squirrel could at least run up the nearest tree , all the way to the thin top branches where no bear could possibly follow .
he staggered backward , flailing for balance , and had he not run into the stiffly jutting branches of a pine growing at the left side of the road , he surely would have fallen down again .
he threw the wood onto the fire one branch at a time , sidearming the pieces awkwardly , wincing at the pain in his knee but enjoying the way the sparks rose in a cloud , whirling beneath the lean - to 's canted tin ceiling like crazy fireflies before winking out .
he grabbed the jutting end of one of the fresh branches he 'd just put on the fire instead .
there was a soft flump of snow falling from one of the pines behind him as the lower branches shed their burden .
pete sat by the fire , unmindful of the bellows of pain from his separated knee , unaware that he was now holding the branch from the fire up beside his temple .

the outfit looks pretty funny , but there 's nothing funny about that agonized face tilted up toward the maple 's nearly bare branches .
duddits has no selective perception ; to him the wino looking for returnables over by the trash barrels , the girls playing softball , and the squirrels running around on the branches of the trees are equally fascinating .
the first idea was that , while they had not come waving olive branches and handing out free intro ? ductory gifts , the newcomers had evinced absolutely no signs of aggressive or hostile behavior .
the ground here is damp - not quite marshy - and they can follow both her tracks and the broken branches through which she has pushed , doing damage they do n't like to think of to her bare skin .
yet the evidence of the damage is there , and they must see it , like it or not - the blood on the branches and then on the rocks is part of her trail .
and so she did , disrobing as she went , unmindful of the branches which poked and the bushes which scratched .
the newcomer 's head snapped around in quick little tics while his body remained perfectly still , reminding deke of the way an owl remains perfectly still on its branch as it looks for prey .

7 mr gray flailed jonesy 's body along the path which ran up the east side of the reservoir from the point where east street ended , slipping , falling , grabbing branches , getting up again .
henry got to his feet like a man climbing a ladder , using the lower branches of a handy tree as rungs .
there was aloe vera ; sea lavender with its bursts of tiny yellow flowers ( each possessing a tiny heart of deepest violet ) ; inkberry with its long spade - shaped leaves ; and my favorite , sophora , which common plants of the florida coast also identified as necklace - bush , for the tiny podlike necklaces that grow on its branches .
lurched out , holding the top of the door to keep from sprawling headfirst into a wall of seagrape and the interwoven branches of a half - buried banyan .
the bushes and branches were so close to the side of the car that they scraped me as i made my way up to the front .
on a couple of occasions i heard seagrape branches scree along the side of the car .
elizabeth even heard daddy humming as he and mr . shannington cleaned up the wreckage in the front yard , daddy driving the little red tractor and mr . shannington throwing drowned palm - fronds and busted branches into the little trailer trundling along behind .
i realized i was sweating , and heavily enough so i could smell myself , like a monkey on a branch .
seagrape and banyan branches scraped along the sides of the slowly trundling mercedes , making hellish screee ing sounds .

the blue spruce knocked its branch against the west wall again .
every second or third august a volunteer crew of summer residents , fueled mostly by beer and gossip , cut back the underbrush and trimmed the overhanging branches along the way out to bay lane , but this had been an off - year and the lane was much narrower than jessie liked .
each time a wind - driven branch tapped at the car 's roof or body , she cringed a little .
the other branch , smaller and mostly overgrown , read kezar notch 10 .
` ` guys , i have to pee , '' said the invisible girl , and of course neither of them took any notice ; they just headed up the branch which led to north conway , walking side by side like lovers and looking into each other 's faces like lovers and arguing like the bitterest enemies .
here the pines which had stayed modestly back from the main trail crowded in , reaching with their blueblack branches , and there was underbrush , as well - clogs and clogs of it .
trisha held onto the conveniently jutting branch of a nearby pine , bent her knees , then reached between her legs with her free hand , yanking her pants and her underwear forward and out of the firing line .
it certainly seemed so ; she had n't gone far down the kezar notch branch , probably not more than fifty paces ( surely no more than sixty , seventy at the very most ) , and so the gap between the two diverging arms of the y could n't be very big , could it ?
a stump of branch thick as an amputated forearm poked ago - nizingly into the small of her back .
this sent up a flare of pain from her lower back , where the stump of branch had jabbed her .
the stub of branch had punched through , then .
i do n't know why we should pay for what you guys did wrong , she thought , ducking - barely - a jut - ting branch that seemed to thrust itself at one of her eyes .
there was a heap of rotting trees and branches , as well - deadwood blown over the cliff 's edge in some long - ago storm .
she saw herself falling toward that jackstraw pile , screaming and waving her arms as she went down ; saw a dead branch punching through the undershelf of her jaw and up between her teeth , tacking her tongue to the roof of her mouth like a red memo , then spearing into her brain and killing her .
trisha grabbed at the branches of an alder and stood looking at the stream , actually smiling a little .
the side of her face where the stump of branch had poked her was bleeding again , too .
then one of those clenches would come and she would find herself struggling through snarly clumps of scrubby trees and thick bushes ( all too many of the latter the kind with thorns ) , fighting past interlaced branches that clawed for her arms and eyes .
if the brook 's low babble got too thin , she 'd drop to her hands and knees and crawl under the worst of the branches rather than sliding along them and looking for a hole .
her pack dragged through the lacings of branches and bushes , sometimes actually getting stuck ... and all the time , no matter how thick the going , the cloud of minges and noseeums hung and danced in front of her face .
that stopped and there was a pause followed by a flurry of mov - ing branches and a rough rasping sound .
trisha stopped by the fallen tree - one hand reached out and grasped the dead jut of a small branch - and looked around nervously .
closer to , a branch snapped .
the sound of two branches rubbing together became the clotted croon of a monster .
she whispered this very fast , and the hand holding the nub of dead branch clutched it tighter and tighter until it broke with a loud report like a starter 's gun .
she knew what it was , after all - just a branch , and one she had broken .
she could still break branches , she still had that much control over the world .
and as her eyes shifted , following nothing but moonlight and a feeling , she heard a branch crack where she was looking .
big shuddery spasms wracked her body , and when another branch cracked , closer , she screamed .
moving through the interlaced branches of the trees ?
she saw only tangled branches against the moon - bright sky .
after an eternity , another branch cracked , this one a little further off .
further off , another branch cracked .
she was looking through a maze of gray tree - trunks and lacings of dry jutting branches , but she thought she could see green beyond them .
she tilted , grabbed a jutting dead branch , screamed in fright and vexation when it snapped off in her hand .
trisha went from one to the next , steadying herself with branches and bushes where she could , holding her arms out for balance like a tightrope walker where there was nothing good to hold onto .
she stood with her hand shielding her eyes , picked out a tree with a large lower branch broken off and dangling in the water , and made that her next goal .
while wading past one of these trees ( there were no hummocks for almost thirty feet in any direction ) , she tripped over another submerged root or branch and this time sprawled full - length , splashing and gasping .
running across the center were more hummocks , but these were brown and seemed made of broken twigs and gnawed branches .
trisha would have angled away from it if she could , but as the swamp ran out it had become choked with dead branches and drowned bushes .
nevertheless she turned toward it , now walking southwest instead of due west , duck - ing under low branches and stepping over fallen logs like someone in a hypnotic trance .
if no wind came up to knock the branches over , she thought she would be fairly snug .
` ` if i am i am , '' trisha said , and added the last two branches to her makeshift shelter .
trisha crawled into her shelter , being careful not to brush any of the branches with her arm or hip .
she grabbed her muddy arms with her muddy fingers and held on , hoping the branches she had so carefully set up would n't all fall down on top of her .
although she wanted nothing except to huddle on the pine needles and go to sleep , she set up the fans of branches again , then crawled in behind them .
all the world 's col - ors looked too bright , and when a bluejay called from a branch overhead , the sound seemed to punch into her ears like needles .
as she made her way slowly downhill , clutching at tree - trunks and branches to keep from falling over , two detectives from the attorney general 's office were questioning her mother and brother .
she harvested the berries from their branches , closing her hand around whole clumps of them and pulling them off .
she broke free of the underbrush and , clutching small branches , backed all the way to the stream .
walking slowly with her legs spread far apart - her butt chafed less when she did that - trisha went back to the pines and broke off more branches , this time meaning to pile them on top of her like blankets .
trisha stood where she was with her arms around her fragrant , sappy load of branches .
as she harvested branches to cover herself with , its face had been perhaps less than three feet from her own ; its claws , the ones which had torn into the trees and ripped both deer apart , had perhaps hovered within inches of her own hands as she bent the branches back and forth , first splin - tering them and then breaking them .

she dropped the branches in a helter - skelter pile and crawled among them without any attempt to create order out of their jumbled chaos .
it would simply tear away the branches beneath which she was cowering and eat her alive .
as she walked back to the pile of branches where she had slept ( like a chipmunk in a burrow , she thought wryly ) , she saw that one of the other needle - filled hammocks - the one nearest hers , in fact - looked disturbed .
she was quite sure she saw a crow hanging upside down from a branch by its feet and cawing at her , and while that was probably impossible , the memory had a quality that many others ( the one of the black helicopter , for instance ) did not : a texture and a lucidity .
her clearest memories were of lying beneath heaps of branches and listening to the red sox while the stars glared coldly overhead .
in this one - the one that existed off the path , the one where crows sometimes hung upside down from branches - she was close to it .
when she felt that thing ( or heard it - several times she had heard breaking branches in the forest as it kept pace with her , and twice she heard its low inhuman grunt ) , she never questioned the fact of its actual presence .
she could see an old fallen log and went to it , slipping between the closely packed trees and ducking under the maddening interlacing branches , hoping ... but it was a log , just a log and not another post .
trisha broke off a branch , reached through the open space where the crank - out windshield had been , and beat at the seat 's stuffing as briskly as she could .
three steps and she stopped , gasping in the wet air and then coughing it out , hardly feeling the leaves and small branches that spanked her neck and arms in the gusty wind .
trisha began moving toward the truck cab again , hold - ing one hand up before her to ward off whipping branches and the other clapped to the top of her red sox cap to keep it on .
water rustled and dripped from leaves and branches ; when trisha raised her head and looked out through the tilted glass - less rectangle where the old truck 's windshield had been , the first thing she saw was sunlight glaring from the surface of a puddle in one of the road 's ruts .
even if she might have convinced her - self ( for a few cruddy seconds or so ) that it was , what about the snapping sound of branches ?
there were leaves and burdocks caught in its shiny fur , and held in one hand - yes , it had a hand , the clawed rudiment of one , at least - was a branch from which most of the bark had been stripped .
its tan muzzle scented at the air , and then it raised the broken branch it held to its mouth .
it sucked at the end of its branch , reminding her of a little kid with a lollipop .
` ` i slipped and cut myself on a dry tree branch , '' i said .
beyond them , the rain had spilled out of gutters clogged with branches and rocks and big sticky piles of autumn leaves .

he stopped to listen , and that was when he heard snapping branches and other voices behind him .
the canal ran straight between its concrete walls for perhaps half a mile ; then the concrete was gone and the river sprawled its way into the barrens , at this time of the year a skeletal world of icy brambles and jutting naked branches .
there were still matted piles of small branches at either side of the stream , but anything else they 'd put together had washed away .
he was fascinated by the way the water boiled whitely out of the cobbled arch and roared past him , bearing sticks and branches and all manner of human trash along with it .
and the water dripping from the wet branches of the trees seemed much too loud .
looking at the branches of elms and maples and oaks against the lead - white sky , stan thought that their silhouettes looked mysteriously thicker .
it was also unchanged , and from here , standing just outside the bowed branches of a weeping willow tree , he could see people passing back and forth .
as the sudden sunlit glint of beverly marsh 's ankle - bracelet had shot an arrow of something more primitive than simple love or affection through his heart on the last day of school in 1958 , so had the sight of the high - school girl 's panties affected him ; he could remember sitting at a table in the children 's library and thinking of that unexpected view for perhaps as long as twenty minutes , his cheeks and forehead hot , a book about the history of trains open and unread before him , his penis a hard little branch in his pants , a branch that had sunk its roots all the way up into his belly .

2 richie had hung his transistor radio over the lowermost branch of the tree he was leaning against .
` ` sure , big bill , '' richie said at once , with no smartmouth at all , and removed the radio from the branch .
papers caught on branches wavered and flapped like cut - rate pennants ; here was a silver gleam of summer sun reflected from a clutch of tin cans lying at the bottom of a green and tangled hollow ; there the hotter reflection of sunrays bouncing off a broken beer bottle .
richie 's transistor was hung by the strap in its accustomed place , on the thick branch of a nearby shrub .
richie 's transistor , robbed of its voice ( at least until richie 's allowance came in or he found a lawn to mow ) , swung from its low branch in a mild breeze .
not the sort of stick that would come with a hoop that you bought today in a woolworth 's ; it was a branch from a tree .

they cut four or five armloads of small green branches , from which ben had stripped the twigs and leaves .
bill laid small twigs and branches over the paper and then looked at beverly .
the branches were catching .
beverly turned and fled toward the clearing and clubhouse , her bloody left arm up to shield her face from the branches which whipped and slapped her .
she ran along the path , branches whipping even more color into her cheeks , one striking her eye and making it water .
behind her , and not too far behind , either , she could hear branches snapping and whipping ; there was a muffled shouted curse .
` ` come on , '' henry said , when the sound of snapping branches and rustling leaves had faded almost to inaudibility .
grimacing ( his belly was stiffening now ; it had gone board - hard , and the blood seeping sluggishly between his fingers had the consistency of sap just before you took the taps out of the maples in late march or early april ) , he got on his knees and pushed aside the stiff hedge - branches .
he remembered branches overloaded with dripping leaves slapping against his face , dousing him with cold water ; he remembered that the thunder and lightning seemed to have become almost constant , and he remembered that henry 's screams for them to come back and fight seemed to merge with the sound of the kenduskeag as they drew closer to it .
a moment later they climbed the bank , slipping and stumbling on the slick wet earth , which was already honeycombed with little running streamlets , holding onto branches to stay upright .
over the rain , he could hear another sound : whipping branches , snapping twigs , voices .
scratches from branches and brambles crisscrossed his cheeks .
they lined the telephone wires and roofpeaks of the victorian houses on west broadway ; they jostled for places on the aluminum branches of the elaborate tv antenna on top of wally 's spa ; they loaded the wet black branches of the elms on lower main street .

glimmering on her wrists and fastening her to the lowest branch of the eucalyptus , which was the only tree in the clearing , was something the bourkas had apparently taken a fancy to before sending baron heidzig into the mouth of the idol and to his undoubtedly terrible death : the baron 's blued steel handcuffs .
hanging from the lowest branch of this tree was an old - fashioned pair of blued steel handcuffs .

going home had not been a part of her plans thennot her conscious plans , at least - but it began to seem to her that if she did not re - establish some of her old ties , a valuable inside part of her would begin dying by inches , the way a vigorous tree dies from the branches inward when it is deprived of water too long .
just as i had said , there was a rope hanging from a thick branch .

there had been a wasps ' nest in the lower branches of their apple tree behind the house .
one of his older brothers - he could n't remember which one now - had been stung while swinging in the old tire daddy had hung from one of the tree 's lower branches .
he had raked a big pile of rain - dampened leaves under the branch where the wasps ' nest rested , a deadlier fruit than the shrunken but tasty apples their tree usually produced in late september , which was then still half a month away .
the tightly packed branches showed through like the skeletons of halfdismembered corpses .

no sound but the creak of the rope against the branch and the crows off in the corn .

it grew on the inland side of the highway , its tangle of dark branches and column of thick , irregular bark emerging from a reddish , waxy tangle of poison ivy .

as soon as they reached the opposite side of the road , one of the territories trees visibly stretched out , root and branch , for them .

spreading out from the main avenues like twigs from branches , the broken asphalt roads give way to brick lanes , brittle barbecue shacks with torn screen doors and collapsing roofs tucked into alleyways behind big white colonials hidden behind gates of thick ivy , which , in turn , are secreted behind the commercial districts of block stores and low - stacked parking garages .

it was a remarkable feat , of course , to be able to corral the spirits of so many , to force them to comply perfectly with the encryptions on paper , in the hopes of creating an aural moment which had been experienced in exactly the same way thousands of times over in other concert halls , in other places , and through the conduits of other vessels : there was a divinity to this flow of meaning through different veins , as though something insubstantial , yet wondrous were rushing through branches and through branches of branches and possibly sub - branches of sub - sub - branches to blossom out in consonance , as though realizing , in full bloom , ones own neglect of a hitherto dormant code which had been hiding always within .

i now had a unceasing desire to own , not any real life - sized horse , but the animated , miniature horse ; i coveted that sweet petite animal , and waves of ardent pleasure overtook me just to think of owning such a treasure ; if only some mysterious magician poured these miniature horses out of a gorgeous green bottle ; if only a genie would only conjure his from a brass lamp ; if only he were tied up at a pint - sized hitching post behind some dusty boxes on a shelf at toy mart ; as i finished stooping under a branch to gather another dried orange , i popped up inside my secret vantage point , my golden spyglass , again only to discover that someone had changed the channel so that the frame was occupied by other lilliputian characters ; this time it was human members of the worlds parade , counterfeit conquistadors , who served out their ordinary days of drudgery as accountants and dentists .

i think he knew then that something had gone wrong , for although he stood on the crest of the hill above the valley , surveying his handiwork and booming out that it was good , when he came to rest in my branches that evening , alone , he tossed and turned , no longer rapt with the stars , and when he chose not to create the next day but instead wandered everywhere , looking closely at his handiwork , his light was muted .

beta leapt over branches and skirted around hummocks with an agility and skill i did nt possess .
when the mighty fall from the heights of a tall tree , they break the branches supporting them .
it was dark and i could n't see nothin ' out there , just the branches of that big old willow tree bangin ' on the window .
the branches will hang to the ground , my boy can hide under the tree .
` ` a tree with branches that my boy can climb .
he can hide in the branches .
he looked around and saw the tree lying on the ground , almost a single branch with three small yellow leaves at the top .
my boy will climb the branches , the branches will hang to the ground , big branches covered in little leaves .
my boy will climb the branches , the branches will hang to the ground , big branches covered in little leaves .
my boy will climb the branches , the branches will hang to the ground , big branches covered in little leaves .
it now dominated the side of the house and its branches hung to the ground .
the branches were gnarled and twisted and almost black with lots of tiny hairs which made it seem fuzzy in the morning light .
melly sometimes sat on the porch and watched cassandra play under the branches , almost hidden by the drooping , gnarled and distorted branches .
melly sometimes sat on the porch and watched cassandra play under the branches , almost hidden by the drooping , gnarled and distorted branches .
arnie had objected once when cassandra had climbed the lower branches , but melly said it was all right , that the tree would not harm cassandra , that the two of them got along very well , that the tree would look after the little girl .
melly had scolded her and warned her that she would go to bed without supper if she did n't come at once , but cassandra just stayed under the tree , hidden beneath the branches , gnarled and twisted .
cassandra was lying there , on her back , staring up into the branches of the tree .
the branches of the willow were swaying violently .
he lifted a branch , saw cassandra looking up into the tree and tried to climb under the branch , but it threw him to the ground .
he lifted a branch , saw cassandra looking up into the tree and tried to climb under the branch , but it threw him to the ground .
the branch was heavy on his back , but he managed to get a good hold on cassandra 's leg and he began to pull .
that was when the branch grabbed his hand .
but when the branch fell down , you remember , it was loose , too much snow over winter ...
when you were in the hospital we both took that old branch out back and burned it . ''
the branches were leaning against the glass , swaying , and she could just make out the moon through the black coils .
some of the top branches still had leaves , small and thin , left over from last fall .
she placed her small hand against the window and several branches spun upward , pushing against the glass .
she smiled and her eyes shone in the moonlight and the branches tapped gently against the window .
she had spent much of the summer hidden under the giant branches of the tree .
he jumped off the porch and dropped to his belly then crawled beneath the drooping branches and disappeared .
even though it was a bright day it was dark beneath the hanging branches of the willow tree .
cassandra was sitting on a thick branch just a few feet from the ground , looking down , her eyes shining in the dim light .
several smaller branches seemed to be wrapped about her waist .
she slid off the branch and jumped to the ground .
chad was about to crawl out from under the tree when the branches stiffened .
he looked up , still trembling as the branches of the tree seemed to close in on him .
she raised her hands and the tree began to quiver , the branches swaying .
suddenly a large branch swung down , spiralling down , coiling , twisted and gnarled , about the boy .
then he began to pull the branches aside .
suddenly several branches swung aside and there was an opening and he saw chad , sitting at the base of the tree , hypnotized , a large branch coiled about his waist , his eyes staring blank and straight , his hands lying loose on his knees .

the branches dropped suddenly .
it was at the front left corner and completely dominated the house with large drooping branches which hung to the ground , twisted , black and gnarled .
see that big branch , just above your head ?
the branch seemed to collapse and harold vanished beneath a cloud of tendrils covered in new growth .
sandra ran to the tree as the huge branch rose slowly and harold pushed himself to a sitting position on the ground , bewildered .
` ` that tree , that branch , it just came down and - '' harold jumped to his feet , shook his head and licked his finger , holding it in the air .
the branches of the old willow moved slowly , almost imperceptibly , waving , gnarled and twisted .
sandra opened her eyes at the sound of the branches tapping the window and harold peered through the glass .
` ` yes , i 'll take off the branches from this side ... the ones that keep banging against the window . ''
he leaned forward , toward the window , and said in a loud voice as though he were talking to the tree , ` ` i think i 'll cut off the branches from this side . ''
the tapping of the branches increased .
` ` maybe i 'll chop down the whole tree ... maybe i 'll - '' a large branch banged against the side of the house and a picture fell from the wall , the glass shattering as it hit the floor .
` ` i think it 's a good idea , trim the branches away from this side of the house . ''
the wind had died down and the black branches pressing against the window were motionless .
there was no wind and the branches hung quiet .
neverthless , the thought of cutting off a few branches seemed exciting , somehow .
the top branches had begun to sway , slowly .
` ` today ... soon ... just a few branches , just next to the house . ''
then he said , more loudly , ` ` i 'll cut off just a few branches . ''
he jumped back as the tree rustled , the lower branches now beginning to move slowly .
he walked slowly to the nearest branch and poked it gently with the saw , his back arched , arm extended .
the branch was thin and wavered slightly then hung again , motionless .
he crouched and swung his sword from left to right across the thin branch .
it caught , stuck , and he pulled back and the thin branch followed , clinging to his sword .
he jumped back and raised the sword and the branch fell away .
a thin twisted branch fell to the groud , severed from the evil willow , the bane of mankind , the dark scourge .
he raised his sword and lunged forward again and another thin branch fell to the ground and again he backed away .
then a large branch swung slowly from above , descending , its shadow racing across the grass toward him .
he scrambled away from the evil tree , sword biting , hands bleeding , jumped to his feet , backed away , several thin branches clung to his jeans and he swept them to the ground in one swift gesture .
a saw lay on the ground , covered in thin branches .
he grabbed the saw and branches and ran to the shed , throwing the branches to the ground and the saw onto the small wooden table .
he grabbed the saw and branches and ran to the shed , throwing the branches to the ground and the saw onto the small wooden table .
that was when the branches began to bang against the window .
the bumping continued and the window began to rattle as a large branch banged repeatedly against the glass .
the tree seemed to move , its branches seemed to rise and fall .
after a time she began to complain of the stains on the window and the constant rubbing of branches and the lack of sunlight on that side .
he had promised to cut it down , but never did more than remove a few branches .
he stooped and peered through the branches , hanging to the ground .
he lifted a branch and it watered his arm .
he stooped and began to make his way under and through the hanging branches , gnarled , twisted , distorted .
he tried to raise the branch , but it was stiff and wet .
every branch was like a steel bar , a prison - he was in a prison , a prisoner of the willow tree .
the branch dropping slowly from above his head .
a gnarled , twisted , distorted branch , coiling and uncoiling , coiling and uncoiling .
at the front left corner stood a gargantuan willow tree with soaring branches which arched high above the house then fell in a wild tangle to the ground .
he wiped the dust from the front window , leaned forward and saw the branch of the old willow tree soaring above the roofline , swinging back and forth , a single massive arm reaching with black fingers against the sky , then down , down toward the cab .
he rubbed his eyes again , slid off the seat , the branch came through the window , glass shattering , radio blaring .
butch was holding his breath , crouched on the floor , looking up with wild eyes at the coiled branch operating the lever .
a black coil leapt from the heavy branch which now filled the cab and spun around his hand .
the heavy branch jerked , suddenly , still wrapped around the control lever , the huge steel ball came straight down .
butch closed his eyes and leaned heavily against the door and the door fell open and he tumbled to the ground , black coils twisting and turning out the opened door , spinning about his arm , and the ball hit with a sickening thud , flattening the cab , the shattered front window popping out in a lazy arc , the heavy branch caught in the twisted , crushed wreckage and the coils which held his arm uncoiling , spiralling away .
he was beyond the span of branches , then he was at the edge , now he was beneath .
it hovered directly over him , its branches reaching out , gnarled and black .
the fall from the crane must have broken his leg , but he began to slide backward , pushing himself away from the descending branches , falling in a tangled rage , collapsing about him .
the canopy of branches now hung above him , quivering .
then the first branch fell , landing beside him , shaking the ground .
then another branch fell and he heard screams .
` ` that tree there , a bloody big branch fell , we cut it off with a chain saw .
it rose like a giant black octopus with its branches still waving , agitated , quivering .
huge branches covered the ground around the base of the tree .
the tree did actually look menacing , black and tall , large branches lying about its base .
he stopped just short of the overhanging branch and looked up .
the tree was moving slowly , the branch swaying .
` ` get ready to run , '' he said in a low voice , his head turned slightly toward his wife , then he pulled the pin with his teeth and tossed the hand grenade under the branch .
then they saw a branch rise in the air , coiling and spiralling upward .
then they saw the grenade released , from the fingers of the branch , falling to the ground , rolling across the driveway toward them .
the shell roared toward the tree before a tongue of flame , in a high arc , landing amid the tangle of branches .
there was a deafening explosion and two large branches fell to the ground .
butch screamed with excitement , then settled back and smiled , squinting his eyes , drooling , staring at the willow with its branches beginning to rise in the air .
he dropped in his second shell and it streaked upward , then down into the tree , into the wildly gyrating branches .
butch was now covered in black hairy branches from the shattered tree .
suddenly the loose branches spun about the barrel of the mortar launcher , smoking , bursting into flame , yet continuing to grow , black coils spinning about the hot barrel , then about his hand .
the tree leaned toward him , dropping , in slow motion , branches reaching out .
its branches seemed entangled in every pipe , drain and sewer .
every time a wall came down a branch or two had to be removed , the entire wall on that side was riddled with roots .
another had been injured when he was clearing the broken branches ; he needed seventeen stitches .
they would now cut off the branches and leave the trunk in large pieces .
then he slowly walked forward and warily climbed into the tree and began to cut the upper branches .
a large branch fell with a resounding crash and the crowd clapped and cheered .
then another branch fell , and another .
the backhoe stopped and the driver climbed out and ran to the base of the tree , disappearing into the hanging branches .
he looked around and saw the cut branches on the ground .
he kicked at a branch and it moved only slightly .
a branch came rushing to the ground and landed beside him and colby walked backwards several yards , stumbled and fell , jumped quickly to his feet then turned and ran to his car .
it might fall on someone , perhaps a weak branch - '' ` ` betsy , i ' ve thought about this and little else for years and now i ' m convinced that it was the willow .
he thought he saw the tree raise several branches to hover above the crowd in some encompassing gesture , but he must have been mistaken .
in the front left corner stood the willow tree , towering above the roof , branches hanging to the ground .
a branch fell on him , was n't that it ?
the tree began to sway and he reached out to steady himself on a thick and twisted branch .
it was a thousand miles to the ground and he fell for hours and the branch caught him just before he reached the ground , pulling him high into the air , its teeth glinting in the bright sun , spiralling about his waist then his neck then he could n't breath and turned his head from side to side trying to free his arms then tearing the coils from his mouth then he screamed .
she looked over the back fence , over the small tree with its branches rising , curiously distorted against the glow of the city in the distance .
tripping over the branches lying on the ground , she grunted , kicked the small tree .
the window exploded , a violent eruption of shattered glass , the hairy branch leaping through , wrapping itself about her wrist , she screamed and more black and twisted coils spiralled through the window and spun about her waist , gnarled , distorted , and sophie brenner was dragged screaming through the broken window , triangles of glass cutting through her dress , her feet vanishing into the night .
two workmen hurt - one died cutting branches with chain saw .
` ` when they took down the old willow tree the branches were twisted ... there were a number of tightly wound coils .
* * * cassandra placed her hand to the window and the great tree bent , tendrils caressing the glass , spinning to outline her hand , dancing branches gently swaying .
to ahriman they prayed , kneeling before the great tree , in the driving snow , in the dark , amid the tangled branches , black and twisted .
together they carried the child to the tree , for the winds had died and the snow had cleared and the branches of the great willow rose like a fountain and a hollow appeared in the ground , and cassandra laid the child in the hollow , before the tree , before willow , before ahriman , and they all began to chant .

it was old and delapidated but there , at the front left corner , stood a giant willow tree , black and sinister against the moonlit sky , its branches hovering over the roof of the house .

she reached out and a light wind came up and the branches began to wave slowly .
she touched a branch .
* * * cassandra moaned as ahriman mounted her , rising in a dark shadow that encircled her naked body , rising as a tree with serpentine branch , to probe , to devour , to protect .

cassandra walked to the tree and the branches parted and she entered the lightless vault .
it was a thousand miles to the ground and he fell for hours and the branch caught him just before he reached the ground , pulling him high into the air , spiralling about his waist then his neck then he could n't breath and he turned his head from side to side trying to free his arms then tearing the coils from his face , gasping , then he screamed .

the branches hung gnarled and twisted , swaying gently , caressing her .
a thin branch curled gently about her leg .
the thin branch uncoiled from her leg , sliding into the shallow hole at the base of the tree , coiling about the small pink and bleeding body lying there .
cassandra stood back and watched as the branches moved inward , sweeping the ground into the hole , covering the body and sliding over the soil , smoothing it , cleaning away the small stones .
her voice has risen to a shout , yet the branches moved slowly , quietly , coiling about her leg then uncoiling , rubbing , smoothly , silently .
she waited but there was not a movement of the solemn branches which hung limp and twisted by her leg .
cassandra turned abruptly and walked out from under the tree , the branches parting to let her pass .
she left and the branches slowly descended , gnarled and twisted , hanging to the ground , hiding the shapes in the vault beneath the leafy canopy .
it was as though she stood in the myriad shadows of a tree whose branches cast a darkness upon her body , hiding , here and there , a bright white sun .
first the outer branches , then under the tree to its trunk .
at the side was the tree - a willow tree which towered over the house , its branches still and motionless in the afternoon sun .
at the driveway he stopped and stared at the tree , mentally going through the motions : cut the branches , then the trunk , watch it fall , dig the hole , pour the gasoline , light the match .
` ` god of light , take my sister into your arms - bless her with the gift of life - carry her from the depths to the light - from the root to the branch - from the evil grasp of ahriman to the arms of ahura - mazda !
the willow tree towered above him with branches waving and agitated and he fell backward onto the damp ground .
he got to his feet and swung the saw up to the nearest branch .
the branch fell away from the tree .
he moved forward and swung the saw across another branch .
the saw cut through the branches like butter .
the branches got heavier , thicker - but they did n't stay still .
the next branch withdrew and rose in the air , hovering , black and hairy .
he reached up and swung the saw in a wide arc across the branch .
there was a scream , as though the branch itself was screaming .
he tried to tear it away from the branch , but it was stuck .
then the branch coiled about the saw and whipped it from his hand .
bryan backed away - into another branch .
it spun about his waist and lifted him from the ground , higher and higher , and he was passed to a second branch , then to another , up the tree , from branch to branch , his hands bound so tightly by coils that he could n't move them , his body held so tightly he could hardly breath , and he was passed through the inner darkness of the willow , a hollow core of blackness , then suddenly out into the light , bright , blinding , at the top of the tree .

the horizon was miles away and the clouds were clinging to the hazy purple hills , and the tree began to sway and he reached out to steady himself on a thick and twisted branch , but it spun around his wrist .
then he saw the chain saw , held by the branch , held high , swinging to and fro .
the teeth were moving , slowly , and the branch swayed like a cobra , holding the saw before him , then the teeth moved more rapidly until the spinning became a blur and the sound rose to a shriek and the branch shivered with its prize .

then a branch caught him , spiralling about his waist , pulling him high into the air , then a shrill screeching filled his ears and he saw the teeth , spinning , falling , and he drew back against the branch and it broke ... severed by the whining teeth of the falling chain saw .

together they walked to the door , and out , and the giant willow rose like an octopus , its branches black and twisted against the moon .
they walked to the tree and the branches parted revealing an inner sanctuary glowing with ghostly forms .
together they entered and the branches fell behind them .
the branch shivered , coiled , and bryan 's body was limp .
the twisted branch was joined by others until his body was enclosed in a seething mass of gnarled and hairy limbs covered in fine green - black leaves , and he cried out , but in vain .
she turned and the branches parted .
then the branches parted and he fell gasping to the ground .
she held out a fragile hand and a thin branch reached out , a tendril twisted and dry , barren of leaves and shaking , yet it spun about her hand .
the willow began to shake violently , uncertainly , the quivering branches dropping parched and shrivelled leaves .
willow began to move , slowly at first , then black and hairy tendrils fell from everywhere , across his back , then twisted branches coiling , spinning , descending .
he scooped them to his chest and the tree cried aloud and the wind roared and cassandra , mistress of ahriman , witch and concubine of the devil , the ghastly creature stood behind him , wreathed in trembling branches , her eyes flaming .
another shot and the bones exploded in a puff of dust and the tree sighed , branches falling in limp cascade about her body .

but he found a big fir with branches so thick the ground beneath it was dry , and she sat down there , with her knees hugged up under the poncho to preserve her body heat .
the sloping branches of the big fir created a natural runoff , like a living umbrella spread over her head .
he broke a small limb off the fir and used it to sweep out his chosen sanctuary , then used the trenching tool to gather more branches from the surrounding trees , not taking too many from any one tree , and laid the limbs in a crosshatch pattern on the floor of the opening .
not only would the evergreen freshen the musty smell , but the limber branches would provide something of a cushion for the sleep mat .
the trees overhead would filter the smoke through their branches , breaking it up so it did n't form a plume , and the weather would dissipate it anyway .

the low branches of a nearby bush shifted suddenly as if someone had walked by them , making them snap back into place .

she then propped her hands on her h*ps and peered upward as she turned in a slow circle on the spot , trying to judge which tree was the largest and likely to get her high enough to see the castle , yet had branches low enough that she could reach them to start her climb .
she 'd thought the branches of this tree were low enough to make it easy , but evelinde had never climbed a tree before and had n't a clue how hard it would be .
the lowest branch on the tree she 'd chosen was low enough that she could hook her arms over it , which she did at once .
evelinde then tried to lift her leg to the branch , but her leg apparently did n't go that high .
grimacing , she moved farther along the branch until she was closer to the tree , then planted one foot on the trunk of the tree and sort of walked up it while hanging from her arms .
evelinde was quite proud of herself when she managed to get her legs hooked around the branch , too , but then hung there , uncertain how to get herself from hanging under it to perched on top .
once evelinde had got the mare as close as she could to the branch , she released her reins and patted her neck soothingly as she whispered , ` ` pray , do not move . ''
straightening in the saddle , evelinde grabbed the branch next to her and used it to steady herself as she climbed carefully to stand on the mare 's back .
much to her relief , the mare stood perfectly still , and evelinde was able to get herself to a standing position and simply step onto the branch of the tree .
unfortunately , her slippers were not made for such endeavors and had she not been holding on with both hands to the branch above , she surely would have slipped off .
the branches grew out in all directions , some too close together , some too far apart to make it anything resembling easy .
sighing , she examined the branches above , trying to decide which would be the best to reach for , and had just settled on one when the snap of a twig made her pause and glance around .
grinding her teeth together with determination , evelinde started upward again and had climbed up to the next branch when something breezed past her and a soft thunk sounded to her left .
startled , evelinde removed her left hand from the branch she held and started to turn to see what she 'd heard , but the branch she stood on chose that moment to snap under her feet .
startled , evelinde removed her left hand from the branch she held and started to turn to see what she 'd heard , but the branch she stood on chose that moment to snap under her feet .
crying out , evelinde grabbed wildly with her free hand , her fingers catching at a very slim branch and holding on for dear life as she scrabbled to find purchase with her feet .
once it had , evelinde glanced down toward lady to see that the mare had moved back several more feet to get out of the way of the branch that had fallen and was now eyeing her with accusation .
she would never enter these woods alone again , evelinde silently vowed , then raised her head to glance up to the branch she 'd grabbed hold of .
her heart , which had just slowed , now seemed to stop altogether as she realized she was n't holding on to a branch at all , but the shaft of an arrow .
evelinde was so startled at this realization that she unthinkingly released it at once , leaving her only holding on to the original branch with one hand .
panic reared up in her , and she swiftly grabbed for another branch , relief roaring through her until she heard , ` ` wife ? ''
` ` i am letting my legs rest , '' she responded promptly , then moved her legs about until she brushed against a branch .
he sounded furious , she noted , looking about to see which branch would be safest to step down to next .
evelinde had reached the last branch and dropped to sit on it , intending to push off and drop to the forest floor when she found herself caught in strong hands and eased to the ground instead .
it was wholly possible that the arrow had sat in the tree for years or longer , and the sound she 'd heard had been another branch or even a bird 's nest falling from one of the upper branches as her climbing shook the tree .
it was wholly possible that the arrow had sat in the tree for years or longer , and the sound she 'd heard had been another branch or even a bird 's nest falling from one of the upper branches as her climbing shook the tree .
evelinde must have caught it on a branch during her climb and caused a small tear .
when cullen 's eyebrows drew together on his forehead , she rushed on to say , ` ` it was probably a branch or bird 's nest dropping past me and hitting the tree on its way down .
i was shaking the branches a good bit with my climbing . ''
evelinde continued , ` ` anyway , i instinctively released one of the branches i held to look around and see what i had heard .
the branch i stood on chose that moment to snap , and i grabbed for something to hold on to , and once i regained a safe purchase with my feet and peered at what i had grabbed , i saw that it was an arrow . ''
the branches of the tree i was in were in the way .
she ran , not caring about stubbing her bare toes on exposed roots , heedless of the small branches that caught at her shirt .

staring up through the thick branches overhead , she spotted small slices of a deep purple sky .
he rolled away from her and , propping his arms behind his head , gazed up through the bent branches of the willow to the fragmented pieces of bright blue sky beyond .
it would n't be too difficult to pull herself up onto the lowest branch .

every once in a while they 'd stop and hold back a tangle of vines and branches so grace could pass and then they resumed their journey through the dark .
she jerked her head up , and my breath caught when i saw her wobble on the branch she was trying to balance on .
i yelled as she bent down and grabbed hold of the thick branch with her hands .
i crept into the tree while holding onto a branch at the side of my head for support .
she stood up , her legs shaking , and i held onto a branch above my head as i walked both of us toward the trunk .
our legs dangled together off the branch .
she seemed really little next to me , like any minute she 'd fall off the branch , unable to hold herself up .
i could still reach the branches , even after it 'd been trimmed .
pulling up the window and leaning out , i spied the branch sliding against the panes above me .
i let my gaze wander through the maze of branches , shaking off memories of which ones i 'd scraped my leg on or which ones i 'd sat on with tate .
i 'd decided to take matters into my own hands , instead of hiring someone , and chop off the smaller branches jutting into the house myself .
crawling through the small window on our dark third floor , i maneuvered myself onto the tree and inched towards the trunk where the branches were thick enough to support my weight .
i needed to work top to bottom and eventually get to the branches at my window - the whole reason i 'd started this job .
grabbing a branch above me , i pushed myself up onto my feet and climbed over to the other side , careful to stay out of the view of tate 's open doors .
i slid down another branch , starting to feel like a perv for snooping on their conversation .
i turned left and bounded through a mess of fallen branches and wet foliage .
three turkey vultures swooped overhead , and a dismal wind whipped through the bare branches of the oak trees .
luce gasped as the top of the marble statue teetered over them , like a tree branch swaying in the breeze .
through the glass panel in the door , luce could see the wobble of a tree branch in the night .
then there was a jagged stroke of light , something that looked like a tree trunk with branches - no , like a torso with long , broad limbs .
a white horned owl crooned in the high branch of the oak tree over their heads .
she opened her eyes because nothing had happened , except for the rustling sound of a tree branch .
but when she looked back , it was just the same : in just one plane of her vision - as if she were looking through bi focals with a wild prescription - the live oaks , and the mulch beneath them , and even the songs of the birds in the branches - all of it seemed to wobble out of focus .
light sifted down through the branches of the oaks behind the gym , casting dappled shadows on the lawn that led to the lake .
from up here , she could see the top branches of the enormous old oak down in the center of the graveyard , where she and cam had had their afternoon picnic what seemed like a very long time ago .
he led her under the strange , gnarled coupling of the branches and took her hands , tracing her fingers with his .
then , through the branches of the tree , she saw him .
the cloud of shadow - locusts had settled in the canopy of a tree beyond the cemetery and had been making sizzling noises in the branches .
their branches were waving , weighed down by the thick , oozing blackness .
back through the jagged live oak branches and the ramshackle stacks of broken headstones .
in the branches ahead of them , she saw three small but seething shadows hanging upside down like bats .
a slinking , black , familiar shape lurking alongside the true shadow of a low redwood branch a mere ten yards in front of her .
the shadow twitched under its tree branch but stayed put .
roland grinned impishly , producing a long , thick branch from behind him .
seconds later , the branch was raised , the drumbeat changed , and it seemed like the whole party had dropped what they were doing to form one long , animated limbo line .
once the game began , the line moved quickly ; for three rounds , luce shimmied easily under the branch .
she swung herself up onto a low branch that stretched behind shelby .
shelby picked up a pinecone and pitched it at the center of the shadow where it draped down from the branch .
one side of the shadow was sliding , very slowly , away from the branch .

he said the trees were birches , standing there all leafless , but with their branches grown together so he must bend his head to squeeze beneath the boughs .
there were great tall trees , spaced verra evenly , all around him , and smaller ones , saplings , grown up between to make a wall of branches .
i ducked automatically beneath a low magnolia branch ; i did n't know whether jamie could actually see in total darkness , or merely felt things by instinct , but i had never seen him stumble , no matter how dark the surroundings .
jamie 's hat flew off , knocked by a low branch ; he caught it deftly and clapped it back on his head , but not before i had caught a glimpse of his face , unguarded for a moment , the lines of it tense with anxiety .
there was an eddy pool , where a large tree had fallen into the water , its branches forming a trap for all the debris that drifted downstream .
the night was quiet around us , with little sound but the lapping of water , and the occasional scrape of submerged tree branches against the hull .
i leaned out and caught a branch of the willow , and wrapped the painter round it .
the boat had drifted halfway round , so that the drooping branch hung now between us .
he rose , and taking hold of a branch for balance , stepped out on the gravel and pulled the plaid up over his shoulder .
undernourished ; ribs countable , arms and legs slender and pale as stripped branches .
something was moving under the branches , swaying heavily from side to side , on all fours .
the indians had left us a portion of the bear meat , tidily wrapped in oiled skin and hung from the branches of a nearby tree to discourage the attentions of skunks and raccoons .
looking up a nearly vertical rock face into a dizzying tangle of dark branches , sparked with gold and green and brown , i was inclined to think the horses were lucky to be stopping at the bottom .
we made our way along the back of one ridge , only to find our way blocked by a great heath bald : a patch of mountain laurel that looked from a distance like a shiny bare patch among the dark conifers , but closer to , proved to be an impenetrable thicket , its springy branches interwoven like a basket .
jamie heard me and turned , smiling , holding back a limber branch so that i could follow him .
we climbed a granite ledge , thick with moss and lichen , wet with the omnipresent flow of water , then followed the path of a descending freshet , brushing aside long grass that pulled at our legs , dodging the drooping branches of mountain laurel and the thick - leaved rhododendrons .
above the reverend 's bowed back , roger had seen the tattered knots of fabric tied to tree branches above the spring .
sleeping under a crude lean - to , squashed into a soggy mass between a large , wet husband and an equally large , equally wet nephew , listening to rain thrump on the branches overhead while fending off the advances of a immense and thoroughly saturated dog , is slightly less so .
rather to my surprise , they had the walls of the first shed erected by the end of the second day , crudely roofed with cut branches until time should permit the cutting of shingles for a proper roof .
enough branches had been removed from the roof to leave a smoke hole ; i could see the evening stars , as i cuddled against jamie and listened to him criticize his workmanship .
while jamie had built us an excellent , sturdy bedstead framed in oakwood , with the bottom ingeniously made of laced rope , i had had nothing to lay on it save cedar branches , which were fragrant but unpleasantly lumpy .
heedless of my footing , i scrabbled my way down the side of the outcrop and rushed toward the furrow , following it under the overhanging low branches of hemlock and balsam .
or perhaps i could build a toboggan of tree branches , i thought wildly , and career down the snowy slopes astride his body .
big ... branches .
six - foot branches , do you mean ? ''
many of the trees were enormous , with the lower branches well above my head , but there were smaller ones scattered here and there .
i hacked at the lower branches , torn between the need for haste and the very real fear of chopping off a few fingers by accident ; my hands were numb and awkward with the cold .
at last , though , i had four good - sized branches , sporting multiple fans of dense needles .
under his terse direction i leaned the hemlock branches fan - up against the face of the rock , the chopped butt ends stuck into the earth at an angle , so as to form a small triangular refuge underneath .
then i took the hatchet again and chopped small pine and spruce branches , pulled up big clumps of dried grass , and piled it all against and over the hemlock screen .
he shuddered violently , making a sprinkle of snow fall from the branches above us .
the snow was falling heavily outside our shelter ; when i paused in the story , i could hear the whisper of flakes against the hemlock branches , and the far - off whine of wind in the trees .
a patch of snow had fallen from the latticework of hemlock branches , leaving numerous small spaces through which i could see out between the needles , peering over jamie 's shoulder .
the ground sloped a little away from us , falling a few feet to the level of the grove where i had cut branches the night before .
the wind had come up in the wake of the storm ; loose snow blew off the branches in drifting clouds , like smoke .
a sudden thought raised gooseflesh on my arms ; if they came through the grove , they might see the hacked branches where i had chopped limbs from the hemlocks .
would enough snow have trickled through the branches to cover my awkward spoor ?
but would they see the branches that framed our den ?
he flung aside the branches with a swoosh , pointing the pistol upward .
the creek itself was boiling past , uprooted saplings , rocks and drowned branches bubbling briefly to the surface .
and i was quite aware that all my actions of the last hour or so had been distractions ; designed to fight off the panic that i could feel submerged below the surface of my mind , waiting to erupt like the sharp end of a drowned tree branch .
i felt my armbone crack with a noise like a dry branch snapping , and tasted marrow warm and salty , slippery on my tongue .
blundering out of the stream , i shoved my way through the tangled branches , and burst through into the clear space beyond .
` ` do n't want to waste it , '' i said casually , and went to retrieve the basket i had dropped under the branches as i pushed my way through the trees .
he was much darker than jamie , too ; while his hair glinted red in the shafts of sunlight that came through the branches , it was a deep chestnut , nothing like jamie 's bright red - gold , and his skin had turned a soft golden brown in the sun , not at all like jamie 's half - burnt bronze .
he had paused to disentangle a long strand of hair from a grappling dogwood branch ; now he came up with me , one brow raised inquiringly .
we could see the serpent fine , then , and we poked at it a bit wi ' a long branch , so it was lashin ' to and fro like the wee book said , but it didna seem inclined to bite itself .
standing on tiptoe to peer over lord john 's shoulder , i saw the torn butt end of a long , slender hickory branch protruding a few inches above the edge of the oblong hole .
` ` the laddie couldna quite get a clear shot , so i gave the thing a wee snoove wi ' the stick , and damned if the bugger didna turn and come at me , right up the branch !
the sky still glowed with the remnants of twilight , but the drooping branches reached nearly to the ground , and it was dark enough underneath to hide them from any curious souls who thought of venturing after them .
` ` come on , '' he said , and ducked under the drooping branches .
and tipped back her head to look up into the dizzy spiral of the branches overhead .
there were wee birds working in the spruce nearby , hanging upside down from the branches , hunting the bugs that they ate and talking to themselves about what they found .
a snag , the remnants of a good - sized tree , its branches reduced to stumps , bark worn away to show weathered silver wood beneath - and a wide split in the wood , through which the bees were crowding , hanging in a veil around it .
sometimes i thought i heard her voice behind me , and turned around swiftly , but saw no more than the hemlock branches , soughing in the wind .
he ducked again , having to walk half crouched for several steps before the branches opened up again .
he shaded his eyes , looking up the trail , but the drooping branches of pine and maple hid everything , presenting only a shadowy , mysterious tunnel through the trees .
the autumn wind rattled the branches of the willows by the stream , a sound like dry , bare bones .
it was cold and cloudy , with a light rain sputtering intermittently among the leaf - bare branches .
then the ground gave way underneath him and he fell in a blur of sky and branches .
twigs bent , sharp ends jabbed him , and cascades of dust , dead leaves and insects fell from the higher branches above as he heaved his way forward , forcing a passage through the close - grown stems , twisting and turning , following such openings as he found .
nothing was visible but the stems and limber branches of the rhododendron thicket .
drooping clusters of cool , leathery leaves , thick stems and slender branches laced together in a nearly impenetrable snarl .
he looked upward , through the snarl of branches .
there was no way to stand up ; he could barely sit upright under the interlacing branches .
on hands and knees , he started off , pushing through crevices , breaking branches , trying his best to go in a straight line .
some small animal ran over his hand and he jerked , hitting his head on the branches overhead .
tall elms bordered the walled garden ; somewhere beyond those stark bare branches lay the mountains .
ulysses came in , a lighted taper in his hand , and began to light the branches of the great candelabrum .
for four days , they followed him , and finally they caught him , in a grove of aspens , leafless in the snow and their branches white as finger bones . ''
so they went back , and they cut off his head , and tied it in the branches of a spruce .
bits of debris boiled past on the flood ; storm - cracked twigs and branches , a broken board from the hull of a boat , wrecked somewhere upstream .
he gestured upward with his chin , indicating the slats and branches that were temporarily shielding us from the vagaries of weather .
he had turned to pick up his coat , thrown across the lowest branch of an oak sapling .
i fled blindly , branches scratching my face and arms , ankles turning as i stepped in holes and stumbled on rocks .
the long casements were open in the laird 's private sanctum , and the wind swept through the branches of the captive trees with a rush and a murmur that gave the illusion of being outdoors .
the tiny birds popped down from the branches like so many cricket balls bouncing on a pitch , and the bunting flew down to join its fellows on the ground .
i opened this one cautiously , but it proved to be nothing more than the tender tips of fir branches , and a pleasant balsamic fragrance floated out of the unsealed bottle .
i straightened up from the patch of ascaria i had been bending over , thumping my head smartly on a branch of the pine they were growing under .
the walls were decked with myrtle branches , yew and holly , and the fragrance of the evergreens rose up into the gallery , mingled with the smoke of fires and the harsh reek of men .
the fog was thicker under the branches , and i could see no more than a few feet ahead , but the sound of excited shouting and thrashing underbrush guided me in the right direction .
i followed the swing of his kilt up the hillside , ducking as the branches he pushed out of the way snapped back across the path over my head .
these small shrines to one saint or another dotted the highlands , and were often to be found in such secluded spots , though even up here , tattered remnants of fabric flapped from the branches of a rowan tree that overhung the water ; pledges from visitors who petitioned the saint , for health or a safe journey , perhaps .
only a quivering oak branch marked his passage .
crouched to avoid the low - growing branches overhead , he duck - walked along an overhanging ledge , arms outstretched for balance .
we stretched full - length on the cool rock , head to head , peering down into the water , willow branches brushing our backs .
i was idly plucking the clusters of winged seeds from a low - hanging branch and tossing them out into the loch when i noticed the tiny waves against the rocks growing stronger , as though pushed by an oncoming wind .
perhaps i could get hold of a branch .
a warm wind stirred the branches of the tree above us , lifting the hair from my shoulders to tickle my face .
colum crossed to the birds ' cage , no doubt intending to soothe himself as per his usual custom by watching the beautiful little self - absorbed creatures hop about amongst the branches , each a world unto itself .
he held aside an alder branch and i stooped under it .
my arms stretched high above my head as the rope was thrown over the branch of a large oak and hauled tight .
near the top of the slope was a grove of young alders , grown so close together that the lower branches interlaced , forming a green roof over the bracken beneath .
jamie shoved the branches up far enough for me to crawl into the narrow space , then carefully rearranged the crushed bracken before the entrance .
startled , i sat up straight , crashing into the springy branches overhead .
i watched stars winking through the lattice of black branches overhead , and fell asleep again with his comforting weight still warm on top of me .
he stepped off the ledge and made his way down the steep incline , bracing his feet against tufts of grass , catching at branches to keep his balance , not looking back .
as the evening star began to glow among the black pines ' branches , i concluded that in this situation reason was of little use .
jenny slid off her horse and cast about through the bushes like a small terrier , pushing branches out of her way and muttering things under her breath that sounded suspiciously like some of her brother 's better curses .
as he opened his mouth to demand indignantly what she meant by this behavior , i stepped out of the bush behind , and whacked him solidly behind the ear with a fallen branch .
we cast up and down the banks of the river , stumbling on rocks , splashing in the shallows , scratching our hands and faces on the willows that trawled their branches in the pools .
sent to the devil in a pillar of flame , under the branches of a rowan tree . ''
i stumbled down the ditch , cloak dragged over one shoulder , tripping on stones hidden in the snow , banging my shins painfully on half - buried tree branches .
bending , i freed a dead pine branch from the snow .
i waved the branch around my head and shouted .
the snow was much lighter on the ground and the flurries diminished under the interlaced branches of the grove , thin lines of snow stark and sudden on the rocky leaf - strewn ground .
macrannoch nodded toward the trees behind me , and i whirled to see a rider making his way carefully through the branches , a bulky cloth - covered shape draped across the saddlebow in front of him .
i dreamed of genealogical charts , thin black branches , bearing clusters of dates on every stem .
jamie stirred and murmured in his sleep next to me , his movement rousing a fresh wave of scent from the cedar branches under our bottom quilt .
i turned over on the rustling branches , nudging close to jamie .
particularly since the getting of coffee would involve a trip to the stream for water , making up the campfire - oh , god , the wood would be damp , even if the fire had n't gone completely out - grinding the coffee in a stone quern and brewing it , while wet leaves blew round my ankles and drips from overhanging tree branches slithered down my neck .
jamie hung the wet clout from a nearby branch and shook water from his hands .
` ` robin mcgillivray and geordie chisholm , '' he said , holding back a branch for me to pass .
` ` do they , '' i said , ducking as the branch slapped back behind me .
as the branches swished and crackled behind me , i paused to take my bearings .
jamie asked , dodging a water - filled pine branch .
if it was madness from the fever that gripped her , or only stubbornness , he could not tell ; she had clung to the branches of the tree with demented strength , crying out the names of her children - and there had died in the night .
the damp air smelled of soot and the acrid scent of wet ashes , but the blackened patch of earth - some ten feet across , at least - was already disappearing under a crisscross of fresh branches and kindling .
bigger than the average bird , though ; he stopped , bending to peer through an opening in the branches .
he took her arm and drew her away , out of the rain and into the shelter of a clump of hemlocks , where the layers of needles lay dry and fragrant underfoot , protected by the wide - spreading branches overhead .
` ` blessed are those who wash their hands after wiping their arses , '' i added , pointing a monitory finger at a blue jay who had settled on a nearby branch .
i pulled the mobcap off my head , hung it carefully from a dogwood branch , and went purposefully to join him .
roger wondered , grasping the springy branch of a pine to keep from sliding down a patch of loose gravel .
i pulled the soggy mobcap off a branch and clapped it on my head , feeling like an extremely put - upon toad beneath a particularly homely mushroom .
she plucked a clinging branch from mr . wemyss 's coat sleeve , nodding to him as she stepped carefully round him .
was that a footfall on the path outside , or only the evening wind , making the tree branches crack as it passed ?
a light wind had risen , and the bare branches of oak and hickory rattled like sabers overhead .
the man called , and flung the branch that he carried into the fire .
then he let go my hand , stooped , and picked up a branch from the ground .
half an hour of dodging low branches , lurching through streams , and galloping straight up as many hillsides as jamie could point them at , and gideon was , if not precisely tractable , at least exhausted enough to be manageable .
a branch of spruce , unearthly green and cool among the dry bits , leaving its fragrant sap on his hand as he tore it from the tree .
roger cast a quizzical glance at her feet , then ahead , up the mountainside , where a faint path wove through blackberry brambles and fallen branches .
he held the heavy branches back for her and she ducked under them into the pungent gloom , gun held carefully crosswise .
there was a stand of aspen at the far side , their pale branches aflutter with a few late tatters of gold and crimson leaves , vivid against the deep blue sky .
swinging round , though , he caught a flicker of movement ; a dark gray squirrel , poised on a pine branch at least thirty feet above the ground .
the branch directly under the squirrel exploded in a shower of wood chips , and the squirrel , blown off its feet , plunged to the ground , bouncing off the springy evergreen branches as it went .
the branch directly under the squirrel exploded in a shower of wood chips , and the squirrel , blown off its feet , plunged to the ground , bouncing off the springy evergreen branches as it went .
the sun through the empty branches overhead made black ripples behind the lids of her closed eyes , as though she looked down through a dark red sea , wading in the blood - warm water , seeing black volcanic sand change and ripple round her feet .
she might have spoken further , but a sound came to her above the rattle of tree branches , and she pulled suddenly away .
i glanced at the chestnut grove , its branches now completely bare .
it stood some seven feet in height , the branches slender , but solid .
the branches had been chosen for straightness and symmetry , carefully trimmed , the ends tapered .
i could hear the sound of the woods , a constant soft sigh of needle and branch .
he had found what he thought was boiling creek , and had ridden up the bank for miles , dodging - or not - overhanging branches , bramble patches , and thickets of witch hazel , but had n't found a sign of anything larger than a fox that had slipped across his path , disappearing into the brush like a flame suddenly extinguished .
i thought i heard a voice outside , raised in distant argument , but it might have been no more than the rattle of tree branches in the wind .
i had dug the largest rocks and twigs out of the leaf mold , cut spruce branches , and spread our blankets over them by the time jamie finished his last round of the camp .
he moved a little , lifting his head in restless query , like a wolf scenting the wind , but no message reached us save a distant rattling of leafless branches .
i lay facing the darkness of the wood , watching the firelight dance among the trees , as jamie moved behind me - behind , between , within - warm and big , and so slowly as scarcely to rustle the branches beneath us .
the stars were spinning overhead , shining brightly through the leafless branches .
the raw earth of beardsley 's grave showed dark with moisture , a humped mound beneath the bare branches of the mountain ash .
the horse was screaming , rearing and pawing with his hooves , and i was scrabbling for a grip on anything at all , mane , saddle , reins ... ... a branch whipped my face and blinded me .
bruises here and there , abraded elbows , and a stinging sensation where the branch had slapped my cheek .
` ` find me a couple of straight branches , about a foot long , no twigs , and a bit of rope from the saddlebags .
she tilted back her head again , as though yearning for the small bit of night sky visible through the interlacing branches overhead .
across the road from this pothouse , the men had erected a crude shelter for the horses , roofed with pine boughs and walled on one side with more branches to break the wind .
the horses ' brushy shelter had been reinforced with more cut branches of pine and hemlock , and it looked like a small , lumpy hillock rising from the ground , thickly covered over with snow .
all at once , horses burst from the shelter , knocking down the wall and trampling the fallen branches .
there was a branch of juniper tacked above the window , heavy with its clouded blue - green berries .
the willows were thick with green , but i caught a flash of scarlet through the drooping branches .
he pushed aside a swath of willow branches , ducking to go through .
a chilly breeze stirred the oak branches overhead , and i moved closer to him , seeking his warmth .
` ` however ... '' i glanced through the screen of branches toward the house , which was clearly visible .
she was right ; the distant river gleamed silver through a lacework of green branches , and the air inside , so cozy a few moments ago , seemed now suddenly stale and frowsty .
only the fact that river run was in the piedmont had allowed us to come to jocasta 's wedding ; down here , the woods were cloudy with blossom and crocuses popped through the earth like orange and purple dragon's - teeth , but the mountains were still cloaked in snow , the tree branches sporting swollen buds .
he pushed aside the hanging veil of willow branches , alert lest he disturb some courting couple that had beaten them to the stone bench , but all was well .
they had begun it there , under the drooping branches of a huge horse - chestnut tree , that had sheltered them from the noise and light of a nearby tavern .
brianna disappeared with a ferocious rustling of willow branches , and he heard the hurrying thump of slippered feet on earth as she ran toward the house , phaedre in her wake .
the echoes of the recent commotion had faded ; a vireo sang from the branches of the elm above us .
still , he felt oddly exposed as he walked through the lush grass of the river - meadow , and sighed with involuntary relief , as the languishing branches of the creek - side willows enfolded him in cool shadow .
a trailing branch brushed past his face and he reached to push it aside , feeling even as he did so a faint surprise at the cool green gloss of the leaves , the odd delicacy of their edges , jagged as knives but paper - light .
then he was into the thicket , twigs and small branches splintering around him , raking face and arms as he thrust his way through .
he heard the thump of feet and pressed back into the branches of a pinetree , letting the dark - needled fans swing over him , his musket raised to sight on an opening in the bushes .
a whistling crash punctuated his statement , as something flew through the trees a few feet overhead , shearing branches as it went .
the boom of artillery came again , and another missile crashed through the branches and landed nearby with a thud jamie felt through the soles of his boots .
the air was filled with the pungent scent of tree - sap , oozing from the severed branches , and he thought fleetingly of claire 's garden , turned earth , churned earth beneath his boots , the fresh - turned earth of furrows and graves , and hobson sitting in the sun by the log , the look of surprise not yet gone from his eyes .
the air reeked with black powder smoke , and every so often , something came whistling through the trees like a jabberwock , with a tremendous ripping and snapping of branches and leaves .
why- he had not even time to form the question when the last ranks broke before him , and he saw the horses beneath the tree , the looped nooses hanging above the empty saddles from its branches .
the three condemned men had been sat on horses , the ropes round their necks thrown over tree branches above , and at the signal , the horses had been led out from under them , leaving them dangling .
it flew in and out , weaving it through the branches overhead .
he could hear a rustling noise , and as he peered cautiously through a screen of cedar branches , he made out a human form stretched upon the ground , and another bending over it , evidently struggling to pull some kind of garment off the prone man 's body .
then we were into the wood , and leafless branches lashed at me like whips .
then the trees closed in again , and i could see nothing but a claustrophobic array of interwoven trunks and branches , twined with the yellowing remnants of wild honeysuckle and the flash of scarlet creepers .
looking out through the conifer branches , though , i had a breathtaking view over the small valley where ravenstown lay .
he crammed it inside his shirt to stop it catching on branches , looking desperately for the way by which he had come .
the ground was lumpy , layers of leaf - mold punctuated by upthrusting rocks , studded with stumps and fallen branches .
i leaned out to see it , keeping a tight grip on one of the hemlock 's branches for safety , but it had moved .
i wove my way down the line of conifers , peeking through the branches , and reached a spot near the end of the narrow ledge where i had a clear view of the river valley below .
jamie 's voice came back from the far end of the ledge , half - drowned by the rustle of the branches overhead .
not waiting for a reply , i ducked beneath an overhanging branch and balanced myself precariously on the lip of the ledge , clinging to a rocky outcrop that jutted from the cliff where it met the ledge .
ten feet away , up the slope from us , stood a big balsam fir , its top sheared cleanly away and half its remaining branches charred and smoking .
wedged between one branch and the stump of the trunk was a huge , rounded mass .
there was rope in the field , left from the stump - pulling of earlier days ' work ; jamie whipped a length several times around the pig 's forelimbs , then flung the free end over the branch above .
a brilliant fall sun poked long fingers through the empty branches , administering the last rites of seasonal consolation , blessing the dying earth with a final touch of warmth .
then he saw it ; a bush far down the slope moved , in a way that was n't like the wind - blown tossings of the branches near it .
nothing but the faint rush of wind through the bare branches overhead , and the far - off murmur of water .
he stood up , shading his eyes as he looked toward the creek , where the lowering sun dazzled through the branches .
it was wide and shallow here , with willows trailing leafless branches in the water .
they were n't ; the view from the top of the outcrop showed nothing but a sea of bare branches , tossing to and fro .
reaching under a bush for a dry branch just as this recollection came to him , he hastily withdrew his bare hand , gooseflesh running up his arm .
it had begun to stiffen ; in the end , he was obliged to lay it across the armload of firewood , like a scaly branch .
no sound came but the moaning of wind and cracking of branches ; they were alone .
a hole in the roof of the smoke - shed , made by a falling tree branch .
the roof to be mended and re - shingled and the branch itself to be chopped for wood .
with the trees dead , enough sunlight came through the leafless branches for the corn below .
more than simple rain ; it was a substantial storm , with winds high enough to bend the palmetto trees half over and plaster the muddy streets with torn leaves and fallen branches .
blue - coated yankee cavalry cantered through the forest , flashes of gleaming chestnut coat or gold braid glinting between branches .
she kept glancing to her left , where kevin mcneil moved quietly through the woods , never a branch popping under his feet .
when you cross - country ski , the only sound is the swish of your own skis on the snow , the plop of a heavy clump falling from a branch .
` ` i 'll bet there 's a french branch stuck on there somewhere . ''
overhead , the chickadees and jays chirped to each other , and squirrels shook the branches as they leapt from tree to tree .
` ` the branches move .
although it was afternoon and he could feel the sunlight on his face through the tree branches , all was darkness .
time stopped as the front of the car made contact with the branches in front .
its thick branches shielded us from most of the ice , but the rain managed to slip past the leaves and soak us .
branches and leaves slapped against the car .
it was spring , and the plethora of pale blossoms crowding the branches practically glowed in the moonlight .
except maybe that bottom branch was now easier to reach .
jasper stared up at the murals of circling olive branches surrounding each of the three massive chandeliers in the melville ballroom .
a large italian alder spread its branches above them , providing a slightly shadowy cover from the moonlight .
it soared through the various tree branches , straight into josh 's chest .
the branches swayed with the breeze , and i smiled .
birds sang to each other from the branches of the palm trees , and the sounds of the ocean gave away its close proximity .
it was surreal to return to the scene of jared 's trial , this time in the sunshine where birds sang , happily riding the bobbing branches that swayed with the breeze .
when jared and bex were satisfied with my aim , bex tied a rope to a branch of the oak tree and hung a large log from it .
i could feel the movement of the log , the resistance of the rope as it rubbed against the tree branch , and even the wind speed and how it would affect the path of the bul et .
i picked up a branch beside the dumpster and swung with both hands .
the larger man came at me with the branch .
lanterns suspended from the branches lent the whole scene a fairy - tale atmosphere .
aria flinched at every snap of a twig or branch .
the thinner branches bowed beneath her weight , but she 'd done this since she was a child , she knew exactly how far she could go before the tree would n't support her weight .
pausing , she spread her legs , bracing her feet against two branches that bent to the side .
eyes narrowing , her hands dropped down to grab the two branches supporting her weight .
with their attention distracted , aria plunged rapidly out of the tree , dropping from branch to branch until she released the final limb and plummeted toward the ground .
with their attention distracted , aria plunged rapidly out of the tree , dropping from branch to branch until she released the final limb and plummeted toward the ground .
a dying pine lifted its branches to the fading light and she tilted her head back to peer into it .
light refracted off of something within the branches .
she found a spot behind a drooping willow with its branches dangling into the water of the swamp .
she did n't hesitate as she grabbed the bottom branch of a large oak , swung her leg onto it and pulled herself up .
she leapt up to the next branch , then the one above it as she raced out to the end and launched herself heedlessly outward , not caring how deep the water was as she dove into it .
` ` you did n't even know if it was deep enough when you dove off that branch ! ''
the tree barely moved as she slipped from one branch to another .
near the top she hesitated , her hands rested against two thin branches that swayed almost imperceptibly .
he could almost feel her holding her breath as she waited for the branches to stabilize before lifting herself above them .
the roots snaked down below his belt and the branches reached up until some of them stretched over his shoulder and partly down his left arm .

without realizing what she was doing , helen reached out and ran her finger over the branches , down the trunk until it turned into thick roots .
sure , never any quite so wide or well sculpted as drake 's , and certainly none with intricately tattooed branches etched into them , but that did n't mean she had any reason to be staring , unable to move or even blink .
already he could feel something happening along the branches of his lifemark .
before their eyes , new buds formed on the branches , then unfurled into baby leaves .
even more shiny new leaves had sprung from the branches and she was sure that she could see them sway with some unseen wind .
she could see the tips of the leafy branches of his tree peeking out from under his open collar .
his body was marked with various small scars , and beneath the tight fabric of his left sleeve helen could see the empty branches of his lifemark .
one solitary leaf hung from the tree and it was shriveled and dry , barely clinging to the branch .
he could be as philosophical as he wanted as long as he did it nak*d . she ran one finger along a branch , down the trunk of the tree to where it hit the low - slung waist of his jeans .

madoc found himself hoping in vain to feel something - anything - even the slightest shift of the branches of his tree .
