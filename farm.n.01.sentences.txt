he called me a stupid little farm girl with rose - colored glasses .
since then he 'd called me a few times , he knew i was n't seeing anyone and since he 'd been my first somehow this little farm girl should just overlook his infidelity and turn a blind eye , because according to him i was never going to find better , because everybody in the business cheats .
growing up in a small village with her parents and sister on a small farm , she 'd had plenty of humorous stories to tell him .
she could head back to her parents farm and help out the kids in her old village .
she went through the rest of the evening with them , ending the day in the children 's dining room where she told silly stories of the animals on the farm she 'd grown up on and the antics of her sister as well as her father who had been known to crack a joke or two when the nights were bitterly cold and there was nothing else to do but stay close to the fire after feeding the animals .
she closed her eyes and took a deep , cleansing breath as the pain of her last visit to the farm swept through her .
did that mean that new horses had arrived on the farm ?
unfortunately , there was n't any way to get all the way out to the farm on public transit so she had to drive herself , inching along in rush hour traffic .
she could n't even tell him to get out since , technically , this was his cottage , his farm and all of the horses out in the stables were his .
he owned the farm here in virginia so if he wanted to come to his house earlier than anticipated , he could do whatever he pleased .
suddenly , six years ago she 'd simply stopped coming out to his farm to visit her father , his lead trainer , and he 'd missed her almost painfully .
rachel knew that they often dined together when she was n't here , talking about the horses and the farm , not to mention playing chess together often when rais was n't entertaining the elite of washington and virginia society at the main house .
jim was in his twenties and had only been working on the farm for about two years .
it was a magical , secret place where she could read for hours and get a bird 's eye understanding of what went on throughout the day on the farm .
rachel did n't want to talk about her weekend on the farm with her dad ... or anything having to do with rais .
` ` i went to visit my dad , '' she explained honestly , omitting the part where she had to explain that her father worked on the horse farm of one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the world .
should n't they be out at the farm protecting him ?
it might take her two hours to get out to the farm by car , but when one did n't have to deal with traffic and red lights , or even rights and lefts to get to the correct street , it was much faster .
the pilot simply flew over all the little ant sized cars below , flying directly to the farm and landing on rais ' private helipad .
they were two of the horses that were still on the farm , still producing excellent offspring .
everything was supposed to be delivered to the farm so she could n't imagine anything coming here .
the drive out to the farm would n't be too bad because she 'd leave about three o'clock to inspect the site , then have dinner with her father and spend the night , driving back to her apartment in the early morning to avoid commuter traffic .
wednesday , she saw another man sitting in a coffee shop outside of the floral shop she 'd contracted for the event and by thursday afternoon , she suspected that the same man from tuesday was following her out to the farm for the final inspection .
she 'd visited with her father that evening , but left out the back exit of the farm to get home , just trying to be cautious .
she 'd only arrived at rais ' farm at seven o'clock after getting off of work at five o'clock .
he 'd been the man she 'd followed via the internet all through college , who had kept her away from her father during the summer months when she could have been working at the farm and hanging out with the horses , which is what she would have preferred doing .
if she 'd known that she was one more brunette in a long line of similar looking women , she would have avoided his farm like the plague .
why did you work on those other farms ? ''
the pilot interrupted them as she circled around a wide farm area .
together , they 'd decided to pitch her as desperate to escape the dirty city and unleash her inner farm wife on ethan 's montana ranch .
what if she allowed herself the fantasy of being a farm wife to the sexiest cowboy alive ?
we give them shots , spay or neuter them , then try to find farms where they can be barn cats .
why are n't we in north dakota right now , buying up those farms , blasting that bedrock and getting rich on oil ? ''
` ` and i do n't like messy critters on my farm . ''
craig 's clinic handled cattle , horses and other farm animals .
what if she concentrated her veterinary practice on unusual and exotic farm animals ?
just like when autumn was in labor , he recalled his experiences with the farm animals he 'd tended all his life .
` ` farm or ranch equipment , '' he replied curtly and tossed it back into the bin .
sophie loved the walk , enjoying the smell of the newly turned over soil that was prepared for the seeds from the farms .
green trees , old worn fences and the occasional farm would pass as we drove giving a sense of peace that a world like this still existed when everything else around us moved so quickly .
i asked as i looked out the window and saw another farm pass by .
` ` come here , farm boy , '' i whispered , responding to his earlier the princess bride reference .
` ` it 's a christmas tree farm .
ever since childhood , whenever i had seen an ad in the paper for this christmas tree farm , i 'd wanted to come here .
sure enough , there was a sign that said , lilac greens nursery and tree farm , with an arrow pointing us to our long - awaited destination .
after a brisk walk , we finally made it to the part of the farm that held the firs .
as we dived into our second make - out session in the christmas tree farm , i felt a tiny fleck of coldness hit my nose , chin , and then my forehead .
he had woken me up with breakfast in bed , bringing me an omelet with fresh avocado and a side of strawberries from a local farm .
virginia was beautiful and picturesque as i made my way down the tree - lined back roads dotted with small farms and forgotten towns .
they 're from this little christmas tree farm up in the mountains .
` ` my father , jefferson browne , made a lot of money from his dairy farm in georgia but he always wanted to move back to england which is where he was born so , when i was fourteen , he sold the farm and took my mother and me with him to tunbridge wells .

even though she 'd lived on a farm as a young girl , golden had never climbed onto the back of a horse in her entire life .
she could walk to the neighbors and borrow their phone but this was the drawback of living out in the country on what used to be a turnip farm .
` ` as soon as i ' m back on my feet i ' m coming out to the farm to see dad . ''
` ` i grew up on a farm in iowa , the youngest of four brothers , all of us adopted by maggie and bill kent .
they come in to help work the farms .
we lost everything - our house , farm , all gone .
he was no longer a naive farm boy with lofty dreams and a trusting heart .
they 'd met by accident when he 'd attended a farm symposium at one of the downtown nashville hotels and she 'd stopped by the lounge after work for drinks with her girlfriends .
` ` i grew up on a farm in central tennessee- '' ` ` if you had n't told me before that you were from the south , i 'd have never known , '' she said dryly .
wanting to hear more about his childhood , she asked , ` ` what was it like growing up on a farm ? ''
` ` i did most of the things other kids my age did - played little league baseball , helped grandpa around the farm and went skinny - dipping in the creek every chance i got . ''
his heavily padded pectoral muscles , bulging biceps and sculpted shoulders were proof that he 'd spent years doing a lot more on that farm than just going skinny - dipping .
` ` considering caleb 's lack of education , making the transition from simple country farm boy to running a financial firm the size of skerritt and crowe was a major challenge .
` ` i grew up on a farm in central tennessee and i have two brothers - hunter o'banyon and nick daniels . ''
grandpa got sick that summer and i was needed at home to keep the farm going .
` ` luther freemont showed up at the farm one day to tell me that i was needed in wichita . ''
` ` the documents have been signed for him to take immediate possession of the hickory hills horse farm the first of next month . ''
but now that he was the new owner of the thoroughbred farm she managed , there was no way of getting around it .
` ` i remember you mentioning that you worked at a thoroughbred farm , but i was n't aware that it was hickory hills , '' he said , sounding a lot happier to see her than she was to be seeing him .
as dancer headed for the home stretch , she added , ` ` the name of the farm and where it was located never came up .
` ` i 'd like for you to give me a tour of the farm if you have the time . ''
if she was going to be running the horse farm that his newfound grandmother , emerald larson , had insisted he take over , it was essential that they get whatever had her panties in a twist straightened out so they could at least be civil .
with a plan of action to set down a few ground rules for both emerald and his farm manager , jake followed the path around the antebellum mansion to the circular drive in front where he 'd parked his sports car .
when emerald and her stoic assistant , luther freemont , had met with him to turn over ownership of the farm , they 'd informed him that clara buchanan was the live - in housekeeper .
but they had n't said a word about heather being the farm manager .
why else would she mention the name of the housekeeper and leave out all reference to the woman who ran the majority of the farm ?
irritated that she 'd obviously blown off his request to set up a meeting with the farm employees , he extricated his feet from beneath the animal and covered the short distance to where the brood mares were kept .
` ` if you have any questions about the brood mares , training schedules or the farm 's daily routine , tony can fill you in . ''
` ` needless to say , i wo n't be giving you that tour of the farm this afternoon or holding the meeting you wanted with your employees , '' she finally said as she cradled the baby close .
the favorite to win the race came along with the farm . ''
` ` at least running this farm will look good on my resume , '' she muttered .
she was still upset with him over his disregard for her authority at the farm , but the more she thought about it , the more she realized attending these social events with him could work to her advantage .
his bank handled the accounts for hickory hills and he was n't going to waste his time with a lowly farm manager when he could schmooze with the owner of one of the premier stables in the entire country .
jake had never made her or anyone at the farm feel as if they were beneath him .
and he was probably the only billionaire she 'd ever heard of who sat at the kitchen table to eat his meals with his housekeeper , her teenage grandson and his farm manager .
from the moment he arrived at the farm , she 'd fought what she knew now to be the inevitable .
` ` you do know what 's going to happen when we get back to the farm ? ''
` ` honey , this whole farm is your home .
a shiny royal - blue minivan with the farm logo sat in the driveway .
` ` the farm .
besides , it 's not fair for you to drive your car for the farm business . ''
` ` i 'll only use it to go to meetings and to pick up things for the farm . ''
not quite two weeks ago , he 'd been a carefree , commitment - shy bachelor with nothing more on his mind than paying a visit to his newly acquired horse farm , sticking around for the big race and then he was supposed to be back on the road to l.a .
jake had talked about going back to los angeles and leaving her and mandy the run of the farm , but that did n't mean the custody issue was settled .
effective the first thing tomorrow morning she was going to resign her position as farm manager and find employment elsewhere .
` ` most of the farms around here are hiring , especially this time of year . ''
` ` go work on a farm ... '' ` ` the pay is decent .
he would definitely be going to a farm .
bow tie .. sewn on .. looks real ... ` ` i was looking at doing some farm work to be honest . ''
` ` well , head on out to montoose farm .
god ... daniel found the entrance to montoose farm .
it was a pretty good size , thought daniel , who did n't know anything about farms to begin with .
i run this farm just fine on my own .
` ` just up to montoose farm .
he shook the thoughts from his head and drove toward the farm .
` ` on a farm .
` ` well , i was kind of hoping to go for a nice drive with you and show you my room out at the farm .
he decided to help around the farm on sunday instead of taking the day off , and rosie was very grateful for his help .
daniel drove back in the direction of the farm .
daniel spent his days busting his butt around the farm , sleeping , avoiding carl 's phone calls , and sleeping some more .
he was feeling that way each morning as he got up for work at the farm .
the young man had been on the farm for eight months , and rosie had become quite fond of him .
daniel hopped in his pickup and drove as fast as he could down to the farm .
you can find me a farm in new york , i do n't care .
` ` i have to tie some things up over here at the farm .
he never heard anything but peace on this quiet farm .
` ` do you have someone who can take my place here at the farm ? ''
this farm belonged to my late husband .
she never wanted to run a farm , but her husband had been adamant about it .
rosie lynn montoose was losing her farm .
` ` you worked on her farm , no ? ''
` ` do you know a lot about this farm ? ''
his name was albert and he died a decade ago , but she kept the farm going .
` ` how is the farm doing ?
` ` rosie just about kills herself every single day keeping that farm running .
` ` rosie is losing her farm , daniel .
the three hundred acre farm is being foreclosed .
her farm is not three hundred acres .
i lived on that farm , and i know it is n't three hundred acres .
` ` i ' m sorry , father , i just need to get to the farm . ''
we ca n't go to the farm , it 's too late .
let 's just get a room , and we 'll drive out to montoose farm first thing in the morning . ''
we can have breakfast and then head over to the farm .
the old pickup bounced down the rough gravel roads until they approached the sign , ` ` montoose farm . ''
` ` john , the farm is gone .
` ` rosie , why are you losing your farm ?
after his death from a heart attack , i was made aware of the many loans that albert took out , putting the farm up for collateral .
i could n't afford to hire the men it would take to keep a farm this size up and running . ''
i ' ve never liked him , and he was trying to force me into giving him the farm .
the farm i do n't care about .
i do n't have any friends , and working this farm takes up my life .
` ` mark , draw up some papers , i want to purchase a farm at forty - seven shenandoah road , prairie tennessee .
even if you buy this farm i ca n't afford to stay here .
` ` rosie is signing over this farm to me as soon as we get the two deadbeat horses out of here .
` ` you ca n't take this farm , sam .
i 'll hire men to work the farm so you never have to do this labor again .
` ` father , i 'll stay on the farm with rosie until the horses are on their way .
it might take some time for all the necessary paperwork to go through , but sam wo n't be getting this farm , and your horses are going to be okay .
regardless of where he ended up , daniel knew he would continue to miss the farm , the southern hospitality , and the people of prairie .
that might not be too easy though , as all i ' ve ever done is work a farm . ''
the farm changed me . ''
he was living up at montoose farm .
he stayed at montoose farm . ''
` ` sam montoose set the horse barn on fire out at that farm .
i think rosie montoose lost the farm .
` ` can i ask you something about that fire at the montoose farm ? ''
` ` daniel , what should we do with the farm ?
there are a lot of folks who lost their farms and homes , and that horrible place that beatrice runs is n't suitable for anyone . ''
she should be part of any decision we do that involves the farm .
i think they changed me as much as rosie and the work on the farm did .
i ca n't stomach going back there for a while , some horrible things happened at rosie 's farm .
` ` i drove by the farm and saw the barn burned to the ground .
the farm meant a lot , as it helped me to stop being a selfish prick .
i owe her so much and i could n't stand the thought of letting her lose her farm or being lonely and possibly harmed . ''
` ` are you aware of montoose farm ? ''
` ` mr . giordano , i ca n't run a three hundred acre farm . ''
` ` i ' m willing to build a very nice apartment complex there on the farm .
i want montoose farm removed , as rosie and i are getting married .
in due time , the farm will take care of itself and you 'll be making money .
you have nothing to lose , and from what i understand , your bar is n't that far from the farm , so your regular customers should n't have a problem returning .
` ` actually i ' m in prairie at the farm , and i have a lot to tell you also .
` ` speaking of spoiled , that quilt you made ... it 's a replica of the one that was in my room on the farm . ''
it was in the meadow on the farm .
rosie would be going to the farm for the first time since leaving .
both of our new lives started on this farm .
most of the town had shown up at the farm ; it was a much anticipated event .
the farms were filling up with more livestock , and people had renewed pride in prairie .
i love this farm but please do n't go into labor here ! ''
she was used to traveling to farms and treating large sick and injured animals , not busting into corporate offices .
the farm house and other dwellings will be removed when we put the road in . ''
` ` everything ... '' ` ` i 'll call some movers and have everything packed up and delivered to the farm . ''
after informing mick of the situation , she grabbed a bunch of bright orange tourniquets , hopped back in the truck , and headed to wilkerson farm .
gerald wilkerson was the closest farm near her grandfather 's property .
her friend sequestered herself on an isolated farm , taking care of battered animals , bringing them back to life and trust with her kind , gentle ways and only appearing in public when she needed money to fund her animal shelter and buy medicine for their recovery .
the atmosphere was supposed to be like a state fair but they did n't have farm animals so the families brought out their dogs and cats , and one hamster for the ritual judging .
it 's actually funny how they wait for the kittens to follow them , except when they 're running around the farm .
i might have to do something a bit more drastic than simply hiding out on the farm . ''
and when he 'd found her , living on a farm only a few miles from his house , he 'd been amazed that she 'd been so close all the time when he 'd traveled from one corner of the country to another and even to london to track her down with the various leads he 'd unearthed .
and she laid all of her complaints at the feet of that horrible man who had kidnapped her on this island , ignoring her own part in accepting a contract with an unknown man in a location she had n't properly researched , all because the amount of money being offered was enough for her to take a break for the next six months , allowing her to dedicate all of her time to the animals on her farm .
after sending the car and their driver on his way , the two made their way to town , passing farm after farm .
after sending the car and their driver on his way , the two made their way to town , passing farm after farm .
` ` they have a farm ? ''
every chance he got , he came home and helped his parents on their farm .
* * * the venue was on chalk farm road and kyle ushered me with a tight grip in on my waist to an empty booth .
he 'd built it up from nothing , starting with a workshop in an old barn on the family farm .
` ` he was determined to make a go of the company and give his children something more than a farm weighed down with debt , and you 're dead set on taking that legacy from him . ''
the stone cottages side by side , the quiet , little rivers woven through the village , the beautiful green trees and farm fields surrounded us .
that had been two years ago , soon after her father had died and she 'd been coming to grips with running the rose farm without his guidance .
jordan powell was the rose farm 's biggest spender on the private - client list .
another shot of advice to sell the rose farm and get a life in sydney amongst interesting people .
her parents had never divorced but had lived separate lives , with ivy being brought up by her father on the farm , while her mother indulged her need for cultural activities in the city .
ivy loved the farm .
and she had loved her father , loved him sharing the farm with her , teaching her everything about it .
' do you think for one moment jordan powell would be interested in a country farm girl ?
she had wanted to work at the rose farm , too , and with her computer skills was a great asset to the business .
' as for the rest , i have been thinking of taking a trip somewhere now that everything on the farm is running smoothly .
the farm was a hundred kilometres south of sydney , situated in a valley which had once been a pastoral estate but had become a settlement for hobby farms .
the farm was a hundred kilometres south of sydney , situated in a valley which had once been a pastoral estate but had become a settlement for hobby farms .
' the farm raked in heaps with the st valentine 's day sales .
not looking like a farm girl this time .
she might look like a high - fashion model tonight , but ... ' i work on a farm . '
' a farm ? '
she demanded , frowning over how directly he was coming on to her , even after she 'd said straight - out she was a farm girl .
the farm 's website gave it away and he might have read it when he decided to use their service for his rose gifts .
it was her usual rising time at the farm .
people who worked on farms usually were .
a billionaire would be a great catch for a farm girl .
i know ivy works on a farm , but i do n't know its location . '
being home on the farm did n't really help .
for one gut - twisting moment , she thought he knew the rose farm was hers .
his orders to the rose farm provided hard evidence of how he conducted his sexual affairs .
it 's my rose farm you deal with over the internet .
not through her farm anyway .
he sat completely still , eyes lowered , a pensive expression on his face , probably reflecting on how much business he 'd done with her farm over the years .
true , but ... he needed to find out how profitable ivy 's rose farm was , whether it was on shaky ground , check that she was n't a cinderella in hiding as biancha had been , because he knew only too well that it was the cinderellas of both sexes who brought poison to his family 's wealth .
aware that the housekeeper had to be curious about the decisions she 'd come to in regard to a relationship with jordan , she 'd told her straight out that she owned the rose farm he used for gifts to his girlfriends and had n't thought the attraction was worth pursuing , given her inside knowledge of his track record with roses .
he stopped at the island bench , picked a melon ball off the platter , popped it into his mouth , raised his eyebrows at her stunned reaction to his enthusiastic suggestion as he ate the fruit , then asked , ' can you get away from the farm to do it with me ? '
' i can arrange time off from the farm , but if you do manage to get us on a cruise , jordan , i insist on paying for my own plane ticket there and back and my share of the tour package . '
before jordan had to leave for his family meeting the next morning , they had a happy , relaxed breakfast together and made plans for him to spend the next weekend on the rose farm with her .
and when he came to the farm next weekend , could she please , please , please meet him .
given an affirmative reply , sacha was delighted , bubbling over with a list of advantages to be had in associating with such a man , uppermost of which was experiencing a far broader and more civilised way of life than ivy had been leading on the farm .
she was confident that heather and barry could take over running the farm and managing the business on short notice and would be happy to do it for her , if and when required .
on the other hand , when jordan arrived at the farm on friday evening and presented her with confirmation that a stateroom had been secured for them on a cruise in may , she could n't ignore the suspicion that he 'd used the power of wealth to obtain it .
he showed a keen interest in the operation of the rose farm - how it all worked , the standard orders from florists , hotels , big business houses , the more random number of private clients like himself , though he was never to be again , the greenhouses , the packaging room , the refrigerated store of fudges which were supplied by a local woman who 'd made an at - home business out of cooking them , the computer system for sales .
graham and heather came to lunch on saturday , and jordan impressed both of them with his appreciation of their contribution to the success of the farm .
when the cruise was mentioned , both of them were enthusiastic about a break from the farm for ivy and assured her they would look after everything .
he never seemed bored by the weekends he spent on the farm with her , and on his alternate weekends he invariably took ivy somewhere special - to the blue mountains and the amazing jenolan caves , to port douglas and the great barrier reef , to the red centre and uluru , to the hunter valley vineyards .
' well , well , if it is n't jordan 's farm girl , ' she drawled .
' a farm girl ? '
' on his weekends at the farm we went to a couple of dinner parties at my friends ' homes .
mum told me she worked on a farm and that fitted what i saw of her with you . '
' ivy owns a very profitable rose farm .
' i wo n't ask you to give up your farm .
after the purchase of the ring had been made , she delayed her return to the farm , driving over to double bay and not leaving until she was satisfied that her wardrobe had been suitably replenished with clothes which would not raise a critical eyebrow anywhere .
not only did they identify ivy as a clever businesswoman , but it would undoubtedly amuse people to hear he 'd been ordering them from her farm for years and she had initially rejected him because of them .
jordan had warned ivy he 'd been asked for a press release , and she was safely installed at his balmoral home before details of their romance were publicly released , escaping from the attention of the paparazzi , who subsequently swarmed to the farm to photograph everything in sight , and a bunch of reporters wanting more personal stories about her .
he had the right to build a life for himself and i was n't going to let you take the money he could buy a farm with . '
' i tried living on the farm .
the artist in me craved much more of the world but he had seen too much of it in vietnam and the farm was the only world he wanted .
we still had weekends together , at the farm or in the city .
the horror of dick thornton , the circumstances of her birth , the background of her parents ' marriage , her upbringing on the farm , jordan 's determination to rid her of the nightmare of her biological father and fix every problem that could mar their life together ... her mind was jammed with so many feelings it was impossible to think of what she should say or how to say it .
keeping the rose farm on did n't seem important any more .

the pressure is on for malcolm coleman to give up his farm and leave the country but he is persisting in resisting it .
' it is a large and very profitable farm that has been in his family for three generations .
even so , to walk away with no recompense ... ' ' see if we can buy his farm .
the idea of acquiring a profitable farm without paying a cent might appeal .
the stumbling block was coleman himself , not trusting anything he was offered and refusing to give up ownership of his farm .

' it is madness , this adventure- ' his eyes flashed black resentment at her ' -flying directly to the farm over the heads of zimbabwe officialdom .

more than thirty people worked in the house as butler , head housekeeper , chef , footmen , maids , nurses , chauffeurs and at least another sixty were employed on the farm , stable and gardens .
in ireland scouting locations for an upcoming movie from king studios , jefferson had stumbled across maura 's sheep farm in county mayo and had realized instantly that it was just what he 'd been searching for .
for days now , he 'd been coming to the donohue farm to talk to its stubborn owner / operator .
he 'd want everyone in the tiny town of craic on his side as he tried to sway maura into renting king studios the use of her farm .
you can show me the rest of your farm . ''
she was n't nearly as distant as she had been the first time he 'd driven onto the donohue farm .
while you drive me around your place , you can have the chance to elaborate as to why you do n't want to take me up on my offer to rent your farm for an already mentioned exorbitant amount of money . ''
he was n't here on the donohue farm because he found her fascinating .
jefferson spent most of the day at her farm , following her about , touting the merits of the deal he was trying to make her and then they ended the afternoon over a bowl of soup and some hot tea in her kitchen .
not to mention the changes she could make to the farm itself .
yes , he could find another farm just as suitable for his needs , but he would n't find a prettier one , maura told herself .
it was n't every day a rich , gorgeous man showed up on her doorstep wanting to rent her farm .
i ' ve always worked the farm .
` ` and which was the donohue farm ?
` ` you were the second place i looked at - and i knew the minute i saw your farm that it was the one i wanted . ''
you 'll make your movie on my farm and we 'll both get what we want . ''
` ` but i think we should go back to the farm so michael can close the pub and go home .
whatever else he could say or think about maura , she was nothing if not meticulous about caring for her animals and the farm itself .
` ` everything was agreed on and besides , we ' ve got a signed contract allowing you access to maura 's farm . ''
cara was balancing a waitressing job in westport while coming back to the farm nearly every day to film her small role in jefferson 's movie .
she would content herself in the future with her farm and her child and one day , the man she loved would be no more than a fond memory she indulged in on lonely nights .
her sister might have her sights set on acting , but cara was born and bred a farm girl and knew what needed doing without being told .
` ` you can sell the farm , '' he said offhandedly .
if she did n't have her farm , her work , who would she be ?
so selling my farm , my home should be easy ?
oh , she had the run of the farm , but she remained under the watchful eye of jefferson king .
could she have sold her farm , moved thousands of miles away and given up the cool , clear beauty of the fields for the tangled crush of people ?
she might not have sold the farm , but she could have leased the land to a nearby farmer .
she asked , hoping against hope to convince him to stay at the farm .
she could explain to him simply and deliberately that he was wasting his time staying on at the farm .
since the moment her sister had come to her at the farm , crying over an opportunity lost , maura had been able to think of nothing else but coming here and facing jefferson with what he 'd done .
as if in sympathy with her dark emotions , it had been raining steadily for the last few days and the farm was hardly more than a river of mud .
while she did , she decided on whom she would ask to take care of the farm for a few days and when she had it set in her mind , she said , ` ` i can have things arranged by tomorrow night . ''
on a farm ? ''
` ` me on a farm , '' he repeated , already mentally arranging his move to the country , the woman he loved .
` ` i want to live in ireland , with you and our baby , at the farm . ''
tanner scowled out the window at the tree farm that bordered his one acre plot of land .
` ` my point , '' his cousin said on a chuckle , ` ` is that you knew that christmas tree farm was there when you bought your place a year ago .
and b , what kind of christmas tree farm is open all year round ?
christmas tree farms , by definition , were christmas - based operations , right ?
who would n't have , with a tree farm as their closest neighbor ?
instead though , he had spent the last two months watching a veritable parade of visitors to the angel christmas tree farm .
it was the farm owner 's entrepreneurial spirit .
apparently the angel family who owned the farm , had come up with the idea of expanding their holiday business into a year - round concern .
which , thanks to the angel tree farm - and now , ivy holloway - was looking less likely by the minute .
he 'd lodged at least a dozen complaints about the angel christmas tree farm in the last couple of months .
let him see that the angel christmas tree farm was a big part of the community .
because otherwise , ivy would never be able to protect her christmas tree farm from a rich man who wanted to shut it down .
pushing up and out of his chair , tanner stalked to the window and stared out at his nemesis , the tree farm .
not only the noise from the tree farm , but someone inside his house making noise , too .
` ` mitchell , at least tell me there 's something we can do about the damn tree farm . ''
that farm 's been in the angel family for three generations .
i ' ve got kids wandering over here from that farm and climbing my trees .
` ` you go into court complaining about children making happy noises at a christmas tree farm and you look like the ultimate scrooge .
you wo n't get rid of the housekeeper and you ca n't do anything about the damn tree farm .
` ` but i have to ask , if you hate christmas so much , why 'd you buy a house right next door to a christmas tree farm ? ''
he shot a glance out the window at the darkness , and as if he could see the farm , shook his head .
` ` turns out , the owner of the farm feels the same way you do .
she used to work at the farm during the season , selling jams and jellies and the wreaths she made . ''
she had spent countless hours walking the acreage of the tree farm at his side .
which was exactly why he 'd felt comfortable retiring to florida to join his daughter while leaving the tree farm in ivy 's hands .
` ` you said you trusted me to take care of the farm .
she had every spare dime invested in the tree farm .
for the last few months , they 'd been hosting weddings at the farm and had made such a name for themselves that they were getting couples from as far away as los angeles and seattle .
or to help feed the animals angel farm kept in a small petting zoo .
and , while the people were at angel christmas tree farm , they usually had lunch at the newly established cafe and bought decorative items and crafts made by the ladies in town at the gift store .
she was so close to making angel christmas tree farm a year - round financial success .
in this farm .
ivy had taken out a big loan to improve and expand the farm , and she 'd gotten a terrific interest rate - because she 'd agreed to a huge balloon payment that would come due all too soon .
` ` steve , '' mike said softly , ` ` i ' ve known you since you were a kid sneaking onto the farm at night to play hide - and - seek with your pals . ''
she 'd keep her farm , her family 's legacy and once this loan was paid off , she 'd never again take such a high - risk gamble .
even the christmas tree farm seemed different lately .
he looked out the window at the tree farm and the late afternoon sun speared into his eyes .
` ` not surprising since you 're running back and forth between the farm and the rich guy 's place .
he 'd been working at the tree farm since before ivy was born and he knew the place - and her - very well .
girl , you ca n't run the farm and the gift shop during the day and work for king at night without wearing yourself out . ''
` ` all the complaining that man 's done about the farm , it 's only a matter of time before he does something bigger .
and some of the guys who worked for angel tree farm were downright territorial over the shearing process .
` ` oh , that 's great , '' ivy said , remembering the couple who had wandered the farm area for hours before coming in and booking their wedding .
` ` only makes sense , '' patsy told her as they started walking across the farm toward the front gate .
this is what she 'd been hoping for by expanding her farm .
the two women continued to talk over plans as they wandered across the farm .
maybe the mistake he 'd made when angry about the christmas tree farm was in going to the sheriff instead of dealing with the owners directly .
he stared out his office window at the swarms of people wandering the farm 's long neat rows of trees .
he 'd never been to a christmas tree farm and seeing all the different types of trees spread out in front of him was ... pretty .
still , in comparison to those who thought angel christmas tree farm was a paradise , he probably sensed the scrooge mitchell had named him .
the farm was laid out well , he thought , recognizing the planning and the care that had gone into the angel christmas tree farm .
the farm was laid out well , he thought , recognizing the planning and the care that had gone into the angel christmas tree farm .
she paused as if considering something , then admitted , ` ` angel christmas tree farm took a big loan out for the expansion .
if anything goes wrong ... '' he frowned , both at the proprietary way she was talking about the farm and at the worry in her voice .
` ` we could lose the farm . ''
so the farm was in danger of going under if it could n't pay back a loan .
housekeeper , christmas tree farm worker and bridal consultant ? ''
` ` you know , farm stuff . ''
` ` anyway , you said i should have talked to the farm owner and i realized that you had a point .
she started walking back toward the front of the farm and tanner fell into step beside her , listening as she continued .
` ` well , i just meant we as in angel christmas tree farm .
they come and have lunch , let the kids paint and then head into the farm to look for the perfect christmas tree . ''
six ivy was finally starting to relax enough to enjoy having tanner on her farm .
in a flash , dozens of thoughts had rushed through her mind , most of them revolving around how to keep him from finding out she owned the farm .
they were far enough away from the main area of the farm that they were pretty much alone .
forgot about the tree farm .
the owner of the tree farm , tanner thought .
` ` i was giving tanner a tour of the farm and- '' ` ` just what kind of tour was this ? ''
still , this was ivy 's employer and the owner of the farm he 'd been complaining about for two months .
` ` i just thought you 'd want me to see that tanner here got a good look at the farm . ''
she gave me a tour of the farm and when we ended up here , i suggested we try out the bounce house . ''
now , you have any other problems with the farm , you let us know . ''
giving mike a brisk nod , he walked off toward the front of the farm and the road that would take him to his place .
and he 's warming up to the tree farm , but he 's not exactly a fan yet , so there 's still the chance that he 'll sic his lawyer on us and we 'll still be up the proverbial creek . ''
when she 'd started all of this , it had been with the idea of getting to know tanner , easing him into small town life and hoping that once she 'd accomplished the task , he 'd stop giving the tree farm so much grief .
he was right , ivy thought , walking with him through the rows of trees , headed for the back half of the farm .
as if the entire world was collaborating against her , ivy had n't been able to get away from the farm any earlier .
she should confess that she owned angel tree christmas farm and tell him all about her plan to soften him up so he 'd stop causing trouble .
her farm manager said , ` ` did n't want to bother you while you were at king 's place , but ivy , there 's a problem with the decorative bridge you wanted across the creek in time for the harrington wedding . ''
there was a huge wedding scheduled for the coming weekend and everyone at angel christmas tree farm was working hard to make sure it came off without a hitch .
or angel christmas tree farm is going to have to find a new manager . ''
` ` you own angel christmas tree farm ? ''
to seduce him into not only liking her , but the town , the valley , so that he 'd stop making trouble for her farm .
` ` you were so determined to make trouble for the farm and you stayed locked up here so no one could talk to you , so- '' ` ` ah , '' he said , moving into the kitchen with a panther 's deadly grace .
` ` must have panicked you when i showed up over at the farm . ''
did he really believe she could have slept with him just to save her farm ?
` ` owner of angel christmas tree farm . ''
` ` calling the damn sheriff , threatening lawsuits every day when you called me incensed over a christmas tree farm of all things .
his gaze shifted unerringly to what he could see of the tree farm .
` ` i overheard her on the phone with her farm manager , '' he said .
lights came on at the tree farm .
small white twinkling lights , strung between the telephone poles and wound through the branches of the trees separating the farm from his place .
there were a couple dozen people wandering around the farm at the moment .
since angel christmas tree farm was so far from any major city , the locals had quite a hand in helping with the event weddings .
because god knew , she 'd given up a lot for this farm and a future that did n't look nearly as shiny as it had only two weeks ago .
then he remembered the big wedding that ivy was counting on to keep her farm safe was tomorrow .
if she could n't do that , she 'd lose the farm .
if that damn farm was gone , he 'd have the peace and quiet that had once been so important to him .
when she took a better look , she recognized tanner , striding up the lane connecting the farm to the meadow .
still holding the can of soda , he walked down the dirt path that led to the front of the farm and the road to home .
not only for angel christmas tree farm , but for the town .
but could n't he have come by the farm again ?
to angel christmas tree farm .
` ` the tree farm is yours , free and clear . ''
epilogue it was the best wedding ever to be held at angel christmas tree farm .
jefferson king , one of their many cousins , lived with his irish wife on a sheep farm in county mayo .
` ` i swear , when i went to knott 's berry farm with them last summer , mia about wore me into the ground .
whitney was about to answer when her father suddenly launched into a monologue on the merits of irrigating farms , which surprised whitney and visibly annoyed clayton .
before they 'd left the farm , she 'd truly thought the whole wide world looked exactly like their own little patch of meadow and that hardly anyone existed beyond its boundaries .
visions of her mother at the farm swirled through her mind ... her mama putting dinner on the table and wearing a clean , starched apron , her hair wound into a neat coil at her neck ... her mama brushing sheridan 's hair with long strokes until it crackled ... her mama leaning closer to the light as she fashioned sheridan a ` ` special dress '' from scraps of lace and cotton someone had traded them .
when the insurance ran out , we sold the farm equipment and everything else we could liquidate to keep paying the medical bills .
meredith hoped he was right , because , if he was n't , it meant she would have to live at the farm while matt was gone , and that she did n't want to do - not with patrick farrell feeling about her the way he did .
` ` you said you did n't want to stay at the farm while i ' m gone , '' he pointed out .
` ` has it occurred to you that the farm is one hell of a lot nicer than where you 're going ?
does he still insist on staying at the farm ? ''
` ` i finally convinced him to sell the farm and move to the city .
i have to go out to the farm later this month and pack up family mementos .
meredith remembered saying something like that to him during the days she spent at the farm .
` ` are you gon na need me when you 're in indiana at the farm next week ?
although his father had been sober for over a decade , patrick was very emotional about the sale of the farm despite the fact that it had ultimately been his decision to sell it .
` ` he 's in indiana at the farm . ''
he came back to the farm and stayed there .
` ` the farm is the perfect place to do it , '' patrick announced , grinning as he abruptly arose .
seeing matt alone at the farm is n't a good idea at all . ''
putting his hands on her shoulders , he said urgently , ` ` meredith , go to the farm .
` ` the farm 's been sold .
without a phone at the farm , matt could n't call the police to have her arrested for trespassing ; without a car he could n't drive off and leave her .
` ` i think it would ' ve been better if i 'd taken her out to the farm , patrick .
` ` you 're hoping that after she tells matt about what her father did and after matt cools down , he might not let her leave the farm , are n't you ? ''
he called me from the car on the way to the farm and said he was feeling better . ''
all her thoughts were concentrated on the past , and on her need to get to the farm and make matt understand what had actually happened .
when patrick had insisted she go to the farm , she 'd still been half numb with the shock of her discoveries .
it dawned on her that she was in remarkably high spirits for someone who was marooned on a farm with a sick man who hated her , but she attributed that to the fact that she was going to be able to put an end to that hatred .
why in the hell had she come to the farm in the first place ?
when sue o'donnell answered his call at the neighboring farm , matt impatiently replied to her inquiries about his family , then he said , ` ` i ' m snowed in over here .
matt instructed him to get out to the farm and pick him up immediately .
he did n't figure it was in matt 's best interests to have a mean of escape from the farm if meredith wanted him to stay .
` ` matt was too sick to listen to me when i first got to the farm , '' she continued , ` ` but yesterday i told him the truth about what my father had done , and he believed me . ''
she stared blindly at the shiny brass doors , trying to concentrate on the memory of the laughter and quiet conversation she 'd shared with matt at the farm .
` ` i agreed to your terms at the farm , '' he reminded her , ` ` is it so much to ask that you agree to mine now ? ''
truce , '' she said , then watched in surprise as matt held his hand out to her just as she had held hers out to him at the farm , except that he turned his hand palm up .
amazed that this moment at the farm had obviously seemed poignant to him , too , she tried to smile back at him as she echoed his former words : ` ` you 're welcome . ''
she had driven to the farm to tell matt the truth about the baby and her father 's telegram ; now he was threatening to use it against her .
` ` and , at the farm , when you asked for a truce , you were n't feeling anything for me then ? ''
from the very first night she 'd met him , there 'd been an immediate and inexplicable rapport that had sprung up between them , a bond that swiftly drew them closer together during those long - ago days at the farm .
it had burst into bloom again at the farm , when she put her hand in his and asked for a truce , then grown stronger , more vibrant , when they sat together in the living room that night , talking about business .
you said at the farm that even if you could start it without the keys , the alarm would disable it . ''
` ` i went to see matt at the farm that weekend , and together we realized what you had done , including preventing him from seeing me in the hospital .
` ` the week after i came back from seeing matt at the farm , the bogus lawyer you hired was arrested , and he started naming his clients ' names , which caused an uproar in the press about matt , parker , and me .
a similar photo had been in one of the albums she 'd packed away at the farm .
later , after we were together at the farm , i began to realize how important that department store is to you , and i also knew that when your father came home and found us together again , he 'd pull out every stop to dissuade you from staying with me .
` ` from the day i came to the farm to tell you what really happened eleven years ago , you ' ve been ruthlessly using everything i ' ve told you to manipulate things until they happen the way you want them to .
do n't know about an accomplice , but you can bet your pension that william 's body is somewhere up at the family farm .
do n't ask me how i know wyatt 's our murderer or that the body 's at the farm .
just found william wyatt 's body , with a shotgun hole in the chest , in an old well on a neighboring farm that was owned by the udall family .
actually , '' he corrected , ` ` wedid n't find it ; the developer who bought the farm a few months ago found it when he tripped over a rusty well cover underneath an inch of snow .
he knew william had disappeared when he was supposed to be at the farm next door , so he dragged the cover aside to have a look .
' ve f - found my dad 's body in a well out near the farm . ''
nephew said the police already have a confession from an old drunk on a neighboring farm . ''
was gone for several days before his wife and son realized he was n't at the farm and reported him missing . ''
you ever been to the wyatt farm ? ''
that well is located a few feet from the property line of the wyatt farm , which you say you ' ve never been near .
you explain , then , how this button from your coat turned up at that farm ? ''
do you suppose a button that you admit came from a coat of yours got snagged on a well cover on a farm you ' ve never been to ? ''
the fourteen - year - old rubbed his eyes with his palms and said shakily , ` ` i went out to the farm with my dad , just like we planned to do that weekend .
while we were walking , my dad told me he was going to sell our farm to the developer who 'd bought udall 's .
the farm was supposed to be mine ! ''
he said he 'd tell the cops i spent the weekend with him instead of going up to the farm with my dad . ''
how did it end up being abandoned twenty - five miles away from the farm ? ''
cecil said it would be better if the cops thought my dad was n't at the farm when he disappeared .
' ve been driving up at the farm since i was twelve .
the search for your father has been called off , no one is looking around at the farm for him anymore , but you went to see mr . elliott and told him you heard mitchell wyatt pretending to your mom that he 'd never been at the farm .
the search for your father has been called off , no one is looking around at the farm for him anymore , but you went to see mr . elliott and told him you heard mitchell wyatt pretending to your mom that he 'd never been at the farm .
you knew that would make us suspect him , and it would also renew our interest in searching the farm again .
the developer who bought the udall place came to see my mom about buying our farm .
he even advised her to sell the farm .
in the last two weeks , they 'd canvassed every gas station and convenience store between chicago and the farm , knowing that cecil would probably have needed to stop at some point .
told me he 'd heard mitchell tell caroline that he 'd never been to the farm , which billy said was a lie .
i am taking the position that when billy left home with his father that weekend , he fully intended to kill him at the farm , which means the crime originated in cook county .
riding in a farm cart , although less prestigious than a coach , was scarcely any bumpier and far more comfortable .
in morsham , mary ellen came from a simple , straightforward farm family which neither knew nor cared about refined manners , genteel behavior , or the opinions of their betters , whom they never came into contact with anyway .
fifteen years ago , when he 'd come to work on the little farm , he 'd slept in this barn every night .
* * * stuffed with apple cinnamon pancakes , they headed to brook farm state park for a day hike .
there was no missing the huge monstrosity of a house with the crooked wooden sign hanging out front that read blackthorne farm ; it was the only house on that stretch of road .
they were the only breaks in darkness for miles as we rolled through illinois farm country .
even now they have to rely on a generator to provide power for the whole island , and there 's not enough grass to farm cows or much livestock .
` ` a one - man farm , eh ?
` ` now we move from the farm to the animal kingdom at - large . ''
when they caught him in the barn with one of their farm hands in a compromising position , so to speak , they packed his bag and kicked him out .

a few miles down the road from the antique barn , luis spotted a farm stand with the biggest cinderella pumpkins he 'd ever seen .
behind the farm stand there was a huge flea market jammed with people and vendors .
he also bought two antique wrought - iron tables for the patio at cider mill farm , and a large painting of the pennsylvania dutch countryside for jase 's office in new york .
jase did n't complain once when luis asked if they could check out a mushroom farm , and he did n't say a word when luis asked if they could pass through a town called bird in hand to see what kind of shops they had .
he wanted to check it out before they went back to cider mill farm and he figured these guys were local and they 'd know better than anyone else .
the faster the rain went away , the faster they 'd get back home to cider mill farm so he could take jase to the hospital and have him checked out thoroughly by a real doctor .
the man had one of those amish beards without a mustache and the woman wore one of those little white hats the amish women wore at the dutch market near cider mill farm .
matthias said , ` ` it was a large farm not far from town that once belonged to a small religious group of what 's loosely considered pennsylvania dutch .
i was picturing a vacant farm , but this sounds more like a shrine of sorts .
and the big red barn is at our home , cider mill farm . ''
they are coming to our home this week to spend thanksgiving with us at cider mill farm . ''
he did n't find it until six months later , in a desk drawer in the living room at cider mill farm , after he 'd already spent more money on more flea medication .
` ` there are a lot of old abandoned farms in these parts .
they did n't want to frighten hunter and everyone else by pulling up to cider mill farm in the middle of the night , earlier than they 'd planned .
it had been pouring rain at cider mill farm , too .
when luis and jase dropped them all off , they gave them directions to cider mill farm and invited them to thanksgiving dinner one more time .
they 'd slept later than usual and luis wanted to get back to cider mill farm so he could start getting thanksgiving dinner ready with isabelle .
when they drove down the long easement road that led to cider mill farm and pulled into the driveway in the new black town car a day early , cory and gage were outside splitting firewood .
by the time luis was ready to pour the coffee and serve the wet bottom shoo - fly pie and pennsylvania dutch spice cookies , rob and rand arrived at cider mill farm and knocked on the back door .
he 'd never heard so much laughter in cider mill farm at one time .
they 'd been putting it off since they 'd moved to cider mill farm and jase wanted to use the barn as a combination guest house and party area .
he loved their townhouse on the upper west side as much as he loved their weekend getaway place in bucks county , pa , cider mill farm .
before we left cider mill farm i had the reverend von klingensmith do a reading for me .
and the small scar on his forehead from the time he fell at cider mill farm was gone .
when it occurred to luis that what he was doing was n't unlike the things he normally did in his real life at cider mill farm , he went about his work without even thinking about it .
though luis and jase had a full time handyman named corey , who was also dating luis 's identical twin brother , gage , luis often did a lot of the yard work at cider mill farm himself .
there was one drugstore near his farm in bucks county that even sold garden supplies .
it was the reason he let the hired hand on his father 's farm fuck him in the barn everyday that one summer .
the small farm fell into disrepair to the point where the uncle had to move into an old trailer on the property .
he was sitting on the same window seat he used to sit on when he was a child and he visited his uncle 's farm , with his elbow resting on the windowsill and his chin in his palm .
it looked exactly like one of the stone cottages at the end of luis 's driveway at what would one day be luis 's house in the country , cider mill farm .
even the white picket fence that surrounded the cottage looked identical to the fence in front of the stone cottage at cider mill farm .
a chill ran up luis 's spine and he felt like asking his uncle to turn around and go back to the farm .
the man standing in the doorway looked identical to his good friend who would one day live in the stone cottage at cider mill farm , the reverend von klingensmith .
boston was the baby of the family and if he got busted for growing a pot farm in their parents ' bathroom , her mother would still defend him .
a menu was set in front of lei , along with a basket of fresh bread and olive oil imported from a small farm in tuscany .
this close to harvest , the smell of ripe corn carried on the air - always a time of excitement for me since i was a farm girl at heart .
i recalled when i was twelve , the neighboring farm boy had dared me to jump off a train trestle into the creek below .
the stylish bras and panties were n't overtly sexual - despite their see - through lace and coy ribbons - but farm girls in nebraska just did n't wear stuff like this .
he told me stories about my mother - she 'd loved to garden , loved plants ; she would ' ve been pleased to know i 'd grown up on a farm .
` ` it 's not that i do n't appreciate everything , but at heart , i ' m a farm girl .
i 'd liked living on one farm my entire childhood with steady - as - rocks parents .
i knew how women got with child ; you ca n't grow up surrounded by farms without noticing what the rams and ewes get up to .
she had n't smoked since moving to the farm three months earlier , but her nerves were shot and she could n't think of a better way to check out for a few minutes .
it was a two - day hike through the rockies to the farm and frankly , she was a little freaked out about living in an intentional community .
her brothers and sisters on the farm accepted her for who she really was .
while dianna had always coddled her , she was given real responsibilities on the farm as a cook .
when she 'd finally asked to use the farm 's lone phone line and checked her voice mail , she cringed listening to dianna 's anxious string of messages .
besides , kevin had split the farm a few weeks after they 'd arrived .
excitedly , she tried to tell dianna about the farm , about what a good experience it was .
` ` i ' m cooking for everyone on the farm . ''
before she could explain things more clearly , dianna said , ` ` the farm ?
what in god 's name is the farm ? ''
` ` i ' m not letting you live on a commune or a farm or whatever you 're calling it .
all she wanted was to be back at the farm with her new friends , but it was raining way too hard , so she spent fifteen dollars to stay at the nearby youth hostel that she and kevin had slept in their first night in vail .
` ` evidently there is one main commune around here that is commonly referred to as the farm by its residents .
evidently , the farm looks clean from the outside , like nothing more than a group of green advocates wanting to live off the land . ''
but word is the owner of the farm has n't been off the mountain in more than a decade .
` ` we do n't normally allow strangers onto the farm . ''
` ` this is the farm , '' the girl said , waving her arms across the rolling open hills .
` ` as i just said to your friend , dianna , welcome to my farm . ''
considering how upset she 'd been inside april 's shack , she barely blinked an eye as she said , ` ` april told me enough about the farm for us to locate it on a map . ''
` ` we are very careful with regard to who we allow on the farm .
` ` i 'd like to give the farm 's telephone number to my producer .
the only people besides dianna who knew she was missing were her friends on the farm .
figuring they had to be wondering where she was , she gave the operator the phone number for the farm .
hiking quickly across the farm to their tent and gear , after sam filled his pack with water , food , and first - aid supplies , they set off toward the campgrounds .
sam 's hand was warm and dry in hers and it felt strangely right to walk through the farm and onto the trail beside him .
she 'll call the farm first . ''
-- - as they drove the dirt bike on the trail back to the farm , sam 's heart went out to the incredible woman holding him tightly from behind .
after what seemed like an eternity of grinding through mud and bumping painfully over endless rocks on the trail , then getting off and carrying the bike over to the other side , they pulled in through the farm 's gates .
the farm 's owner immediately ushered them inside the blessedly warm space looking concerned when he counted only two of them .
everything on the farm was surprisingly clean and she acknowledged that she 'd been too hasty in condemning the commune in her conversation with april without coming to see it first .
but he had listened in from the sidelines when they spoke with the police , knew they were staying up at peter cohen 's farm .
with sam 's help , she 'd partially faced her fear of heights before getting to the farm , but it still killed her that she had to go slow , when all she wanted was to race up and down the trail to find april .
she knew what he would tell her ; he 'd insist on her turning around , going back to the farm , calling the police , and waiting somewhere safe for his return .
he needed help , but heading back to the farm for reinforcements and to call in the rocky mountain hotshot crew and police force was out of the question .
but once i got to the farm and started making friends , they helped me see that i was n't being fair . ''
` ` so , you were at the farm ? ''
that morning , april had headed back up to the farm to reconnect with her friends and make some decisions about what to do next .
she 'd grown up on a farm half an hour outside of washington , d.c . , and had loved playing in the river and streams , but the only time she 'd been out on the ocean had been with her ex a year and a half ago .
she reminded herself that she 'd eaten plenty of dirt growing up on a farm and had lived through it just fine .
mom , it 's an ant farm ! ''
` ` an ant farm ? ''
` ` maybe we should add the ants into the farm out on the front porch . ''
petey bit his lip in concentration as he carefully poured the ants into the farm , and elec could see tamara in the boy 's features , though not as clearly as with hunter .
elec said it casually , staring straight ahead at the ant farm .
petey stared into the plastic of the ant farm and chewed his lip industriously .
pete tapped the plastic side of the ant farm .
so where are you going to keep this ant farm ? ''
the ant farm was set up in front of them and they were watching it as they cracked up to whatever private joke they 'd just shared .
he had stood up and was holding the ant farm carefully in one hand .
i brought pete an ant farm .
petey came over and showed off both his ant farm and his various pox .
tamara was about to call attention when petey slid , ryder lost his balance , and petey 's foot kicked over the ant farm on the coffee table .
` ` it 's alright , '' elec said calmly , dropping to the carpet and righting the farm .
elec shook his hand over the open farm .
it 's supposed to be our ant farm with the glowing gel . ''
he brought them gifts when they had chicken pox - an art farm for petey , a die - cast car for hunter .
and she was n't even remotely worried about her car , he 'd bet the farm on it .
she was thinking in farm metaphors .
harley had heard enough about cooper on race days to know he had been raised on a farm with his grandparents for the first ten years of his life until his mother had married a surgeon , who helped put him on the path to financial success .
how did a twelve - year - old get a thousand dollars to spend on a farm animal ?
not designer clothes and farm animals . ''
no one needed farm animals , in harley 's opinion , unless you were a goddamn farmer .
it was the aftereffect of growing up on a farm .
it was the clothing equivalent of buying from a local organic farm .
` ` you might think you have maggie , but i would n't bet the farm on that one . ''
` ` do you even know what a farm is ? ''
by the time we pass the windmill farms that mark the desert near palm springs , we ' ve played classic rock , classic country , and a varied selection from current artists .
male , female , or small farm animal . ''
` ` i have a farm downstate .
he 'd told her that he left for his farm in downstate illinois on fridays , and it had been thursday night when he 'd ... done what he 'd done to her .
we usually take turns cooking whenever i ' m on the farm . ''
after the busboy left , niall asked him about his farm in downstate illinois , desperate to change the subject .
he explained that he 'd inherited the farm from his mother 's brother over a year ago .
vic still could n't figure out why in the world his uncle manny had made a specific point of leaving him the enormous farm while meg , vic 's sister , was designated as the beneficiary of manny padilla 's financial estate .
he 'd thought about selling it , not having the time or interest for running a large farm since he already owned a ranch in montana .
i 'd already been in talks with the hesse theater when i inherited the farm .
vic could n't justify returning to the farm for the long weekend , as he usually did .
` ` if you think this is wide - open space , then you should visit my ranch in montana or my farm downstate . ''
meg and i went to stay with my uncle on the farm here in illinois for a while .
she discovered that meg was the high school principal in a small town near vic 's farm and that she loved art .
she 'd been invited by vic to spend christmas at his farm downstate this coming weekend .
of course she would still be going to vic 's farm for christmas .
she hung up without a further fuss only when niall pacified her by agreeing to have dinner with her at the art the night before she left with vic for his farm .
he 'd started to long for the wide - open space of the farm instead of obsessing about the play , so he figured things must be going pretty well .
at least he had hoped to do that , if he could talk niall into spending a good portion of her weekends with him on the farm .
she was so nervous and excited about leaving for vic 's farm tomorrow that she practically had n't slept in a week .
and she doubted that she was sowing much fraternal accord by showing up on vic 's farm to live for two months when he knew nothing about it , either .
niall had prepared herself to weather vic 's initial storm of fury at her unexpected presence on his farm .
he knew from experience around the farm that the kid was a good driver .
they were both comfortable in the silence that followed as donny drove down the rural roads to get to the farm .
then she saw the painting of the farm on the wall .
this time of year on the farm really gets the creative juices flowing , you 'll see , '' meg had assured her as she 'd showed her around her airy , spacious bedroom suite .
` ` i ' m boarding here on the farm for the next several months . ''
` ` you 're boarding here on the farm for the next several months , '' he repeated with acid sarcasm .
you 're not staying on this farm . ''
which is all the more reason to say that vic 's reaction to you being on the farm was a good thing .
breakfast is served bright and early on the farm . ''
there was no way that woman was staying on this farm another night .
just what the hell did niall hope to accomplish by showing up on his farm ?
he often helped on the farm , enjoying the manual labor and the feeling of accomplishment that accompanied it , even if he did n't want to make farming his official profession .
in fact , he liked to find excuses to work on his farm .
her complexion glowed with health ... and perhaps an awareness of his anger at her uninvited presence on the farm .
she 'd known rationally that he was going to be angered by her presence on the farm .
but her sole mission on coming to the farm had n't just been to reclaim vic .
the first three weeks of niall 's stay on the farm passed much more smoothly than she would have ever expected or perhaps hoped for , given that the easy going was mostly because vic almost completely ignored her presence .
she sometimes wondered if she would have had a better chance of running into vic on a chicago street than she would on his farm .
she and meg grew closer as they took on several projects on the farm - expanding meg 's already extensive garden , refinishing the farmhouse 's enormous antique front porch swing , or taking shopping trips to bloomington for bulk food items or art supplies .
the tan that he acquired so easily from riding or working on the farm made him even more magnetically attractive .
the following friday vic never showed up at the farm .
a panic rose in her chest every time she considered that her stay on the farm was nearly half over and vic still had n't spoken a dozen words to her since her second day there .
niall had n't worn her pearls since coming to the farm .
after dinner she caught a glimpse of why vic had n't immediately returned to the farm that night .
niall wondered if she was thinking it had been a big mistake to invite niall to the farm .
i 'll take you back to the farm . ''
gravel popped loudly beneath the wheels of the truck when he made a tight turn into the long drive to the farm .
` ` this is what you showed up uninvited on my farm for this summer , is n't it , niall ? ''
it was n't a long - term solution , but the more the boy was safe at the farm the less time he spent in the unhealthy environment of his brothers ' home .
meg and she had offered to get him after the movie , but vic had flatly forbidden them to go over to the farrell farm .
is n't she on the farm ? ''
then she had gambled everything and come to the farm to try to explain .
donny was caught in the cross fire of a shoot - out at the farrell farm earlier today . ''
meg had noticed how exhausted niall appeared earlier , and both she and donny had encouraged her to go back to the farm for a nap .
meg guessed that donny had been riding on the natural pain - killers of shock and adrenaline since the incident at the farrell farm , which had culminated in one of his brother 's being seriously wounded , another man almost being killed , and errol being charged with the latter shooting .
it just was n't right that a young boy should be forced to live in such an unsavory , blatantly dangerous place as the farrell farm .
` ` after that display , the poor man probably would have thrown his farm into the deal in order to make the sale on those tomatoes .
he 'd have been called back down to the farm leagues for the way he 'd messed up that deal .
while i spent my days buzzing around town trying to make money , he spent his time overdosing on the flesh of farm animals .
buck , the big southern guy , looks like an overgrown farm boy .
flanking mac and leo are the barrel - chested robert ` ` bear '' watkins , the would - be farm boy billy ` ` buck '' larson , the ginger pyromaniac anthony ` ` sparky '' rosetta , and the smart one of the bunch , david ` ` dewey '' mackenzie .
` ` i 'd buy a farm in southern france .
sam had spent enough of last summer on the porch of nik 's parents ' store to have some experience discussing farm weather .
at the exotic fruit stand - did they fly it in from some small hawaiian farm to this little , local farmers ' market ?
all right with being gay , or all right with the family wanting to send him off to the funny farm , or something else entirely ?
the countryside was a mellow tapestry of vineyards , villages and farms all gilded with the late afternoon sun .
i should ' ve felt like a heifer at a cattle auction being felt up by some lonely and very desperate farm boy .
with max content for a moment to explore the little plastic farm i ' ve set down in front of him , i plop down onto the couch and kick my feet up onto the oversized ottoman .
from the large butcher - block island , to the dark cabinets , to the farm sink .
when he got a tryout with the rockies and ended up on the farm team , i decided to move to denver . ''
our little north dakota farm girl is all fancied up for her trip to town for the annual pie - and - ice - cream social . ''
i ' ve got a bunch of shots to do for the wicksburg farm flyers . ''
` ` the summer i turned eight my parents sent me to stay at my grandparents ' farm .
we received your name and were intrigued by your ad designs for local organic food outlets , such as wicksburg farms , grass roots , fresh start , and the farm - to - table restaurants like nature 's bounty and juniper 's garden that specialize in the type of audience we hope to target . ''
we received your name and were intrigued by your ad designs for local organic food outlets , such as wicksburg farms , grass roots , fresh start , and the farm - to - table restaurants like nature 's bounty and juniper 's garden that specialize in the type of audience we hope to target . ''
toying with the wholesome north dakota farm girl because she provided a different challenge than the usual skanks you met at the various clubs ?
` ` i needed to talk to you about something before we tackle the wicksburg farm project . ''
let 's get set up for the wicksburg farm halloween bash . ''
a series of interconnected western pieces , different styles , including clay pieces slated to become bronze statues , and welded metal works using rusted sections of discarded farm equipment .
all the farm equipment is property included in the deed ?
sometimes the items were funny , like a miniature windup dancing horse he 'd picked up at the farm supply store .
the farm equipment was ancient .
so i ' m just saying ... '' jack had n't brought his girlfriends home due to his never - ending embarrassment about being raised on a farm .
` ` so you 're embarrassed about bein ' raised on a farm ? ''
he 's taken over running the farm , which is what he and dad always wanted .
we could n't have kept the farm after marvin died if not for jack 's financial support . ''
drove my dad crazy that all i ever wanted to do on the farm was ' ride that damn horse ' .
she wondered if his dad 's attitude played a role in driving jack from the family farm .
i never saw myself living on the farm permanently .
as a south dakota farm kid , raised on the flat prairie , he was amazed every time he looked at the majestic mountains .
they saw her as fresh off the farm meat and decided to cut her down to size , one petty , shallow little slice at a time .
because before my dad died , even when he knew i 'd never take over the farm , he gave me the choice .
as far as shopping went , brandt did n't mind the farm supply store .
right away landon scrambled beside her , dragging his new fleece blanket from grandma joan and his favorite book about farm animals .
but in the two years since the deaths of her parents , rielle wetzler had built the sage creek bed and breakfast to supplement her income from her organic farm .
when granddad died , my dad and his brother sold the farm , split the money and went their separate ways .
when dad bought the hog farm , we had a small cabin to ourselves on the property .
i sold the hog farm to a corporation outta eastern south dakota .
we 'd just moved to the farm and i caught rj climbing on the barn with a quilt that he intended to use for a parachute when he jumped off the roof .
i blamed him for making us move to a hog farm . ''
` ` as soon as robert gave me money from the sale of the hog farm . ''
` ` i earned every penny of that money for the years i slaved at that hog farm , '' he retorted hotly .
i ca n't speak to the logic of that , except to point out that if your father had kicked deck to the curb , would you have pitched in and helped him with the hog farm ? ''
she 'd visited the farm and range land in nebraska .
` ` remember last year when the legislature revised that law about elk farms ? ''
` ` elk farms are n't allowed in wyoming , '' dalton said .
` ` true , but they passed a bill that allowed for privatization of a few elk farms on a trial basis .
when the feedlot had n't looked feasible , he 'd gone so far as to check out privatized wildlife farms in colorado and south dakota to check the topography and containment and find out what type of acreage was needed for how many head .
dalton had n't bothered checking the regulations for elk farms because they were n't allowed in wyoming .
last year the legislature approved a measure that will allow limited private elk farms to operate in our state .
` ` but since we 're in the middle of cattle country , and most ranchers are dead set against any type of elk farm abutting their grazing land , would n't that mean we 'll have fewer applicants because they 'll want the test program to fail ? ''
but the truth is they 'll probably all apply for the permit to have some measure of control about the placement of the elk farms .
but he did n't want to talk about the elk farm possibility specifically , so he hedged .
` ` if we 're making these lines or whatever purely on border issues , then this elk farm would affect almost my entire acreage .
` ` i vote yes for the elk farm .
when the stack of elk farm applications arrived from the cheyenne office , rory was tempted to crawl under her desk and hide .
but the biggest question was why had n't rory known dalton intended to apply for an elk farm permit ?
aka , the land her mother used to own ; aka , the elk farm would be close not only to the house gavin and rielle owned , but to the cabin on the property where she lived .
so how had dalton found out vetting elk farm applications was her project ?
` ` it 's just ... the whole elk farm thing caught us off guard . ''
` ` i ' m processing applications and then screening applicants ' land for the elk farm test program . ''
i imagine you 're getting applications from ranchers whose land fits the criteria , but have no intention of turning it into an elk farm . ''
not only about the application for the elk farm permit but about my real reasons for starting a goddamned relationship with you ? ''
then my priorities changed and the elk farm opportunity caught my eye .
` ` while i still do n't agree with what you 're doin ' as far as applying for an elk farm permit for land that borders our ranch land , it do n't excuse me bein ' a dick to you . ''
only to be confronted by a foul - tempered , big - mouthed , sexist , ageist , government - hating rancher who spewed vitriol from the moment she 'd opened the pickup door until three hours later when she 'd finished the survey of his land for the proposed elk farm permit .
now you ' ve applied for the elk farm .
given the size of the farm , i 'd say between forty and fifty elk is the maximum number for the herd .
` ` any word on the elk farm permit ? ''
and he 's awaiting my decision on the elk farm . ''
` ` this one recommends your land for the elk farm permit . ''
` ` deny me the elk farm permit .
we thank you for the soil that nurtured the silage that sustained the pig , for the farmers who deal with the muck , mess and stench of a pig farm every day so that we might enjoy this tender , succulent roasted pork , simmering in its own juices and spices .
with the way the ag business is right now , family farms and ranches goin ' under , there 's no way any bank would risk it . ''
the day after that , he woke her early in the morning to take her to the farm hamlet just a little ways down the coast to show her where all of their grain came from .
` ` you saw what happened when you tried to take me on that field trip to the sheep farm and they slaughtered that poor little lamb .
` ` well , you snapped at me about the dagger , and you did n't even laugh at my self - deprecating sheep farm comment - which was pretty funny . ''
he also knew they did n't think of it as owning the former farm town , but as developing it to its full potential .
he took a deep breath as he wondered what would have happened had he stayed on at his father 's farm and married her .
` ` compared to the small farm where i grew up , this is a mansion , my lady . ''
then she pulled the cover from the couch and coughed as she unearthed a dust bunny farm of death .
my parents moved here a few years ago after they sold their small farm . ''
` ` like kyros , they came from a long line of soldiers and thought that i should go back to the farm .
arid if she believed that tate was n't crazy and that the daimons were real - because she 'd seen them more times than she wanted to - then she had no choice except to buy this farm tale , too .
` ` appears i do now , '' she said , trying to make carson feel better about his slipup , ` ` daily inquisitor , here i come ... better yet , the local nut farm . ''
i figured he was from a farm and had come to the city to try and make it rich . ''
acheron flashed them back to ias 's small farm where his wife had just sent their two children to bed .
dev laughed as he peeled the wax shell away from a mini babybel piece of cheese -- she did n't know why she 'd bought them since she normally could n't eat cheese without having farm flashbacks -- which were n't bad , just annoying to listen to cows mooing while she ate .
and with that vow , he slipped out the back and into the trees that surrounded the farm where they 'd taken temporary refuge .
no doubt someplace that stank , was hot , and more lethal than a cobra venom farm .
the sun was just beginning its descent , its crimson - gold hue spreading over savannah 's farm , dappling the horses grazing in the distance with warm paint strokes .
as i am of mine who toiled their farms .
` ` do you think we made a mistake forcing aricles to leave his farm ? ''
to protect his brothers and father from the demons that often preyed on their small farm while his father was deep in his cups , aricles had learned to fight like their attackers .
it was what had led galen to learn to fight , too , and was a large part of why galen hated their farm so much .
for a man who lived on a farm , he knew a great deal about philosophy and politics .
so someone had to take care of him and the farm . ''
they 'd been hard and harsh as he struggled with his own grief while trying to care for his brothers and father , as well as their farm .
all the upkeep for their farm , servants , and family had fallen to ari 's young shoulders .
and then when his grandfather had taken ill two years later , he 'd been sent to care for him and his farm until his grandfather had died .
` ` you deserve better than a backwoods farm boy , my goddess . ''
i keep going back to that day on the farm when they came to recruit us .
` ` i should have left you on your farm when you asked me to . ''
we need to start a sex camp where women can tell their hubbies they 're going to a fat farm and instead of the boot camp diet with nazi dieticians , they go to the beach and have hot men treat them like goddesses ! ''
she 'd spent so many youthful summers here on this farm in the california mountains .
i ' m not interested in a farm league .
see : farm league comment . ''
` ` remember when you fell out of that tree on the farm when you were ten , and broke your arm ?
but this time i started thinking , and well - it is sort of weird that you ' ve always been around , you ' ve been like a dad to me , we practically lived on the farm in the summer , and yet neither you nor my mom ever dated anyone else .
luke swinging her up to perch her in the fork of an apple tree on his farm upstate was one of her earliest memories .
like lake lyn- '' ` ` luke 's farm , '' simon said .
there was no need for jordan to come , she 'd argued , since all she had to do was ask luke if it was all right for simon and magnus to visit the farm tomorrow , and then she 'd call up to the farm and warn any of the pack who might be staying up there to clear off the property .

magnus can use the farm .
he had n't expected anyone to come to the farm with him but magnus , though alec had insisted on coming as well ( much to magnus 's annoyance , as he considered the whole enterprise ` ` too dangerous '' ) , and then , just as magnus had revved up the engine on the truck , isabelle had come banging down the stairs of his apartment building and thrown herself through the front door , panting and out of breath .
` ` alec , '' isabelle began , but before she could say anything more , the sign for the turnoff loomed up ahead : a wooden placard in the shape of an arrow with the words three arrows farm painted on it in block lettering .
` ` why did n't we just portal to the farm ?
maia had been silent the whole way to the praetor , as the sun had risen higher in the sky and the surroundings had turned from the crowded buildings of manhattan to the traffic - clogged long island expressway , to the pastoral small towns and farms of the north fork .
she thought of the first time that luke had ever taken her swimming , in the lake at the farm , and how she had sunk so far down into the blue - green water that the world outside had disappeared and there was only the sound of her own heartbeat , echoing and distorted .
in the dream she 'd been on luke 's farm , hanging upside - down from a tree branch , laughing as simon waved from below .
the moon was high , shining down on the lake at the foot of the property , making the rest of the farm glow .

` ` why do n't you live at the farm ?
when we 'd left the farm , i 'd texted cam and asked him where he was .
must ' ve scraped them on something at the farm . ''
jase said he scraped them at the farm and that 's what had to have happened because there was no other reason to how it could have happened .

as if to fit the farm feel , the walls were covered in floor - to - ceiling wallpaper of dusty - rose and green flowers .
` ` wow , '' escapes my mouth as i stare out at the mesmerizing view , no longer paying attention to the path ben drives along , until he pulls up in a sandy spot next to a yellow farm truck , its tire flat and a giant rust hole eating into the side panel .
i just remember taking a long ride in his truck , and chasing chickens and pigs around at some farm .
i hear the big farm truck plodding down the trail behind me .
the familiar rumble and squeaky brakes of the farm truck comes to a stop behind the tractor .

the farm and the stable tristan : at once several naked male slaves advanced towards us .

they can strike the manor houses and the farms and be off before we even know it in the village .

she had been in the village a year when the raid happened , a female farm slave of the lord mayor , working in his country gardens , searching out weeds in the grass with her teeth on her hands and knees , the gardener a stout and severe man , never without a strap in his hand .
two fine steeds for hire at the regular rate to pull the finest coach or the heaviest farm wagon . ''
in a few moments , the lord mayor will be here with his farm cart .
and when we pulled into the farm road , our brief rest in harness was hardly an escape from our new station .
the naked and dusty farm slaves pushed indifferently past us , unloading the cart , then piling it high with fruit and vegetables for market .
driven into the marketplace , we were again allowed to rest , the noonday crowd taking only a little more notice of us than the farm servants had , someone stopping to pat a rump here or slap a c**k there , the ponies who were touched tossing their heads and stamping their feet as if they liked it !

we were going to be walking around a farm at night ; i 'd want to leave my purse in the car .
we did n't talk on the way to the farm .
alcide 's dad 's dad had owned the farm , and jackson herveaux had kept it after he 'd gone into construction so he 'd have a place to run at the full moon .
` ` at alcide 's farm . ''
i remember driving to alcide 's farm with you , and i remember seeing eric and alcide and the pack , and i think i remember - there was a swimming pool ?
he worked on his father 's farm and owned nothing save a small cottage in a far field given to him by his parents .
mr . bromios 's inn , the seventh magpie , normally a warren of empty rooms , had filled a week earlier , and now the strangers had begun to take rooms in the farms and private houses , paying for their lodgings with strange coins , with herbs and spices , and even with gemstones .
they walked down from the village to the forest beneath it , and they walked the whole way past the thorn family farm ( where the gentleman in the top hat was startled by a cow , sleeping in the meadow , which snorted as it dreamed ) until they reached dunstan 's cottage .
then he walked into the farm kitchen , and kissed his mother on the cheek , and helped himself to a cottage loaf and a large pat of fresh - churned butter .
shortly afterward , the farm cat had three kittens : two black - and - white ones like herself , and a tiny kitten with a dusty blue sheen to her coat , and eyes that changed color depending on her mood , from green and gold to salmon , scarlet and vermilion .
he was a gangling creature of potential , a barrel of dy***ite waiting for someone or something to light his fuse ; but no one did , so on weekends and in the evenings he helped his father on the farm , and during the day he worked for mr . brown , at monday and brown 's , as a clerk .
they took a winding lane up toward the forester farm , and the crescent moon hung white in the sky and the stars burned in the darkness above them .
and victoria laughed at him , then , and took back her hand , and began to walk down the hill toward her father 's farm .
the track to the foresters ' farm was bare mud , trodden into mire by the feet of horses and cows and sheep and dogs .
when they could , they stopped at small farms , where tristran would put in an afternoon 's work in exchange for food and some straw in the barn to sleep upon .

his face scrunched up , making him look like the benevolent uncle who wanted to give you the quarter of a million dollars to start your chinchilla farm , but those darn investors just did n't see the potential .
the ceramic was hot on my burned skin , and i changed my grip as i carried it back to the big farm table .
newt hauled me up , pinning me to the farm table .
her old tower and monitor were gone , and an overindulgent , high - def screen she could plug her laptop into now took up a good portion of the thick country - kitchen farm table pressed up against the interior wall .
` ` i ' m sure they were just on other calls , '' i said when the huge farm bell we used as a front doorbell clanged .
ivy asked , looking lean and svelte as she stretched over the big farm table to reach the fib reports edden had couriered over .

i returned to the farm - and found her and my father inside their truck , deep in the heart of their land , smashed into a tree , their bodies slumped over in the seats . ''
as he scanned the crackling fires , the hills with their dead and gnarled trees , he said , ` ` i told you i own a farm .
still , he said , ` ` if ever we 're separated , i want you to go to the farm . ''
i 'll have you know- '' ` ` -worry on my farm , '' he interjected , forcing her to be quiet or miss what he was saying .
` ` you have no need for a chef at your farm . ''
and he 'd asked her to live on his farm .
` ` so , when we get to your farm , are you going to let me feed the animals ?

this was solo 's farm .

for her , or for the farm , or both , she did n't care .
if he tried to take the farm away from her , she would fight him .
` ` but i gave him the farm . ''
` ` you traded the farm for me ? ''
the otherworlder had mentioned solo had been willing to give up a lot for her , but she 'd never suspected his farm .
when solo was n't working , he spent his time at some hick backwater farm without any kind of modern convenience ( shudder ) .

the village had changed little in the past ten years : home to three pubs , an organic farm collective , and a revolving parade of antiques , children 's clothes , and crystal jewelry boutiques .

at first most of his genie friends thought this was hilarious , fazire being stuck with a family in a small , farm town in indiana , of all places , and they poked great fun at him .
in fact , she would n't be surprised if he had told danielle to tell her he was dead all those years ago , tired of the naive , clinging farm girl and ready to cut her loose .

the drive to his townhouse , which was in a development right next to the holliday farm , was , at most , five minutes .

then he put the glass to the railing and trained his eyes back on the farm .
she loved the view of the holliday farm across the way not only because the yellow farmhouse with its white curlicue woodwork was sweet but because finley holliday lived there and he was hot .
he knew from what he heard that aunt debbie was on about selling the farm .
he did n't understand it but from what he heard , since dad died , aunt debbie , aunt dusty and finley and kirby now owned the farm all together .
he was working that farm .
and he knew , because his dad and gramps and aunt dusty mentioned it and even aunt debbie talked about it , but she did it bitchy ( as usual ) , that aunt dusty knew all about the farm .
they needed the farm working .
shit , he needed aunt dusty to come and sort his ma 's shit out and help him make a go of the farm until he graduated in a year and a half and could do it on his own .
it needed to happen so aunt dusty would move home , help with his ma , help with the farm and fin would n't be facing all this shit alone .

and our farm was one of the very few farms left in the town limits .
and our farm was one of the very few farms left in the town limits .
the ' burg had seen a lot of development in the last thirty years as farms had been gobbled up .
the good news was , these developments , at least around our farm , were nice .
but the size of our farm meant spring through fall it was a lot of work for one man .
mainly because he wanted them to have extra and partially because he was a man who had to be busy and there was n't a lot to do in the winter on a farm .
practice , i knew darrin was thinking , for a life on the farm where the days started early and the meals that ended them were huge because they were busy and physical .
you 're riding back with me to the farm so i can change out of horse clothes and we can go . ''
although the farm families were retreating , it still had its working class .
and with the heritage and other high end developments , as well as the ' burg 's traditional elite of wealthy families who worked in indy but settled generations ago in a quaint farm town close to work but away from the city , this meant there was definitely an upper class .
i 'd sat down with her twice to talk to her about the boys , her future , the farm .
i did like the view of your farm off my balcony .
and the reason it did was because seein ' that farm reminded me of you and that felt like home . ''
` ` explain again why darrin left the farm to all four of you , '' mike demanded to know something i 'd told him the night we reconciled .
so , if anyone would have finley and kirby 's backs with the farm , keeping it whole and safe for them to take over , he knew he could n't trust rhonda to do it .
` ` your dad would lose his mind if he thought debbie was pushing to sell the farm to developers , '' mike noted , again correctly .
this is about the farm , not the snow removal .
` ` if feb , mimi and jessie did n't share , which they probably did , the first time i had her in my bedroom , i showed her dusty 's farm and told her about debbie . ''

whatever mcgrath 's intentions are , his vision includes this entire farm . ''
` ` how bad does the boy want the farm ? ''
mike thought of the farm he spent time at as a teen .
` ` shit just got ugly with the farm .
and it 's a little sketchy how he changes the minds of farmers who ' ve held onto their land for five generations including through the farm crisis , convincing them suddenly to up stakes and walk away . ''
she needed a reminder that there was life outside the loss of her husband and this farm .
` ` he wants that farm , they 're f**ked .
this ended with clarisse and fin in the living room at the farm in front of a movie fin rented and me playing video games with kirby in his room so they 'd have privacy .
study - time , dinner and tv - time with clarisse at the farm on thursday .
` ` so , a number of farms have fallen into mcgrath 's hands . ''
debbie opened up the door , mcgrath stepped through and he does n't want her quarter , he wants the holliday farm . ''
` ` lots of farms have fallen to bernie mcgrath , dusty and i use that language purposefully . ''
you worry about that farm , the family in it and your pottery .
dusty 's dad , dean holliday was beyond pissed at debbie and regardless of the veil of grief that still hung at the holliday farm , he did n't mind showing it .
the development on the opposite side of the farm to mike 's was one of mcgrath 's .
with the housing estates in the area surrounding the holliday farm , a shopping area would thrive .
also the holliday farm was bigger than any shopping center needed for a build so there was plenty of leftover space to put in another development that would mean more customers for the center .
things had changed yesterday at the farm for dusty .
now he had to get to the farm , talk to dusty and dean , get debbie 's home phone number and ream her f**king ass .
` ` i ' m goin ' to the farm , '' he announced , all three kids looked to him , surprise on their faces but mike only looked to no .
` ` everything okay at the farm ? ''
the farm would not leave family hands unless fin or kirb owned all the land outright , should they buy out their aunts ' and each other 's portions , and made this decision sometime in their adulthood .
` ` what matters is , legally , the farm is safe .
you contesting your brother 's will has no possible result but more aggravation and heartache not to mention depleting the reserves rhonda has to care for her boys as they try to make a go to keep this farm viable .
she loved the farm and showed it .
` ` she 'll not get the farm , honey , '' he whispered into her hair .
but , breaking it down , darrin looked out for his kids , he owned this farm outright and no judge in the state of indiana is going to find in favor of an attorney who lives in washington dc and makes six figures at the expense of two boys with no dad and a legacy farm .

to make a go of this farm , fin needs help .
especially when it becomes public record a family is battling over a farm he wants ? ''
how about i get you a beer , you can fill me in on audrey and then you can leave but not before you let me make out with you in the cold , dark , early march evening on a farm in indiana ? ''
and she was giving this up for her nephews , her family farm ... and him .
the holliday farm was more than fifty times the space but from april to november , the vast majority of that land was taken up with corn .
when his aunt dusty called fin that afternoon , she told him that she 'd explained to mr . haines that fin was already at the school , he had a ride and reesee was coming to the farm anyway after school to study so why did n't he just bring her home ?
because she was mad for fin and , unlike his mom who , even when fin was in trouble at school , did n't leave that farm or probably her room to see to her son .
unless rees was at the farm and i had to chaperone , i was at his house ( with fin ) .
no got up with his bowl and spoon to take them to the sink , pointing out , ` ` and it would be totally lame , her gettin ' an apartment somewhere when the farm is right next door .
` ` he 's concerned about the bathroom situation at the holliday farm .
the balcony far from sucked and i loved it that i could see my family 's farm from there .
but going to school , coming home , doing his bit on the farm , eating and studying apparently did n't faze fin at all .
` ` did you pay rent on the farm ? ''
i know you came to help deal with the shit at the farm but i also know you came to be with me .
i move back to the farm or find an apartment or i stay here and pay my way .
` ` you ca n't handle that , the farm is right next door . ''
i stood in the double doors of the family farm and stared at rhonda who was lounging on the couch , eyes to early morning tv .
i grabbed a bowl of cereal , downed it fast , wrote a note to mike , no and rees telling them to enjoy their day and i 'd see them that night and carried my cup of coffee over to the farm with me .
and all sorts of shit has gone down all around you and you 're like , in a daze or somethin ' , lettin ' it happen and not steppin ' up for the farm , for your boys , for anyone .
my beloved nephew did n't need to be pissed as all hell and on a tractor with a farm grade rototiller on the back of it .
showing up at my family farm out - of - the - blue dressed like someone out of a tv show about women who spend their time drinking cosmos , having sex , talking about sex , shopping for clothes and bitching about men and she wanted to talk ?
you know where the farm is .
he jerked his head to the farm doors and told her something she knew .
that day they spent with dusty at the farm , dusty and her dad taking the kids for tractor rides .
` ` this farm killed your father , '' she declared .
i got my future and that future , every day , every f**king day i go out and work this farm , i do it with my father , '' fin shot back , his words nearly guttural and not just with anger but with grief burned a hole straight through mike 's f**king heart .
but if he knew you made his sons feel like that , you put their future and this farm in jeopardy and why you have , make no mistake , he would set you out . ''
and you two , if you align with her , are not going to win this farm .
you might have had good intentions , like i see you believe you have with what 's goin ' down with this farm , but in the end , you betrayed her .
she held his eyes , swallowed then whispered , ` ` did this farm kill my husband ? ''
this farm did not . ''
you hurt those boys and put this farm in danger .
and do everything in your power to keep this farm in the family . ''
he asked when she said no more and kept her eyes on the farm without moving .
instead he looked through the room and said , ` ` we need proof on the code violations then i ' m goin ' to mcgrath with that as well as providing him the knowledge he does n't stand down from the farm , his wife gets a head 's up about his extramarital activities .
it was one of the first farms to operate in the ' burg .
now her farm was where the station restaurant , its parking lot and the shops surrounding it sat .
sittin ' down with a cool one , i told her the holliday farm was in mcgrath 's sights and she opened wide . ''
` ` farm sold years ago .
we got ta approach anyone who stuck around after they sold their farm and see if these tactics were used with them .
they stopped in the vast area between the farm and the house , she turned and looked up at him .
` ` uh ... sorry , mike , that farm is not worth getting disbarred . ''
it 'll stay buried but you f**k with dusty , rhonda , those boys , any of that family or that farm in any way you can , it sees the light of day and you face disbarment and jail time .
with four people working the farm , the corn was nearly finished being planted .
` ` he says he 's got ta worry about that farm and when he 's not , he 's got ta do it up , have fun , last chance he 's gon na get .
next year , it 'll only be him who takes care of the farm , he says .
so by the time i hit the backdoor of the farm , i was winded but it did nothing to make me even one iota less pissed .
all sorts of shit she , '' he leaned toward me again , his hands in fists at his side , ` ` can not do if her ass is rotting on a f**king farm ! ''
` ` i got what i want in this farm , aunt dusty , '' he said quietly .
you can write bestsellers on a farm , fin .
` ` miracles happen on this farm . ''
then he ordered , ` ` do n't leave the house or farm all day . ''
stay close to the house or farm all day .
standing by fin close to mike 's back gate in the big side yard between the farm and mike 's row of houses in the development , i smiled at no and rees galloping blaise and moonshine around the big space , layla dashing between them .
` ` mike , oh god , mike , '' it was jo in dispatch , ` ` shots fired at the holliday farm . ''
just hittin ' the farm with their dad 's guns , gon na make some noise , scare the crap outta fin and rees .
on his farm .
` ` see , '' she started , ` ` i used to sit out on my dad 's balcony with my dad , look at your farm and think that when i grew up and got married , i wanted to have a bedroom just like my dad 's . ''
there was intricate , lacy woodwork in the corners of the posts holding up the porch roof ; the lawn looked like mine , green and healthy ; and the pristine rows filled with the wide leaves of the growing corn , both spiky and bowed , all of it exquisitely cared for and cultivated showed these farmers loved their home , their farm , the pride went deep and it was amazing to behold .
` ` grew up in this ' burg and my high school girlfriend grew up on that farm , '' mike told me and i looked up at him to see his eyes on the farmhouse .
her brother runs that farm now . ''
` ` i always loved that farm . ''
` ` fuck no , '' he grinned , ` ` still , liked her farm .
` ` craig works for his dad 's farm supply shop , out on 36 , '' colt told her , she nodded and he continued .
the deep - bowled farm sink .
it looked kinda silly on a farm table but this was our first dinner as husband and wife , this was our first dinner ever ( for me ) and this was our pre - consummation dinner so i wanted to make it an occasion and nothing said occasion like delicate china , heavy silver and elegant crystal , even in a rustic cabin .
this was happening and it was my choice whether it happened in the loft or on the farm table .
` ` further , the house of ulfr owns a variety of farms that raise mink , ermine , sable , rabbit , cattle , and the like .
chapter six mrs . truman abby sat at the big battered farm table in her grandmother 's huge kitchen .
by ` ` home '' patty meant their little farm town , fifteen miles west of indianapolis , this topic being a recurring theme of their conversations these last months .
according to mrs . k , her husband took care of the grounds , oversaw the gardeners , allowed or disallowed hunters as the case may be and also maintained and oversaw several other properties and farms that douglas owned in the vicinity .
she heard her before she saw julia come in the back split farm door to the kitchen , a way that tamsin had sometimes used , douglas never used and julia nearly always used .

then we went to the station and gave our statements about the happenings on to the kevster 's pot farm .
i would have paid to see his face when he walked into that pot farm . ''
last time hank played bodyguard , i led him to a pot farm and it was on al three networks .
i asked after i 'd gotten over indy and jet 's stories of murder , gunplay , pot farms , strip club mayhem , knife wielding men , rampant kidnapping and assault by taking a shot of uncle tex 's homemade , gut - dissolving hooch ( okay , maybe it took two shots , one for each story ) .
` ` and those pepperidge farms milano thingies .
there were oreos , chips ahoy , four different types of milanos and a plethora of other pepperidge farms choices , nutter butters , pecan sandies and a variety of archway and entenmanns on the coffee table in front of me .
i was the one who found his ass , and i 'd also been there when hank had the kevster arrested for trying to save rosie 's unattended pot farm - a pot farm unattended because rosie was in hiding .

he rolled his eyes and walked past her to the christmas tree farm behind their house .
after a long , hard day working on the farm , all she needed was another reminder that there were no available gentlemen in the area , and even if there were - hers would not be the first door they would beat down .
you ca n't take the farm out of the girl .
it was n't possible , not when one 's whole life revolved around said farm .
i ' m assuming she 's a cow or some sort of farm creature .
it was one of the reasons that despite growing up on a farm , she was fluent in french and knew how to cook french cuisine better than the best chefs in new york .

i almost lied and said i had an ant farm then realized that if that was the best lie i could come up with ; i was better off shaking my head and embracing the awkward silence .
` ` i wanted to own a lizard farm . ''
` ` a bully crushed mine when he told me lizard farms do n't exist . ''
a farm accident had nearly killed him , but it did n't keep him from volunteering his time .
` ` yes , well , i do love farm animals . ''
tell me , my dear , do you like being compared to a farm animal ?
a huge group of kids had gone back to his parents ' ` ` farm '' after the services .
the farm was really just this barn that had been decked out into some sort of playboy clubhouse .
it looked more like a reception room for an upscale plastic surgeon than the funny farm .
no , not the funny farm .
she had been on her way home from visiting the small farm where she placed those women willing to leave the streets , when the gypsy had suddenly stepped before her carriage .
` ` then , why do you not escort me to the farm you have purchased for your young women ? ''
` ` it is not really a farm .
she could not deny that she harbored a reluctance to allow this gentleman to accompany her to the farm .
earlier i wagered that i would discover your small farm fascinating , and i assure you that i did so . ''
any strangers unfortunate enough to pass close to the farm would find no smiles awaiting them , and the only warm meal would be themselves .
there were a few rusting farm implements scattered about the floor , and a pile of old newspapers that were being slowly nibbled to bits by mice .
whoever had once called this remote farm home had long ago left for greener pastures .
biting into an apple , she glared at the barn filled with the usual machinery needed for a small farm as well as a pile of old bikes and forgotten toys that were tossed in a corner .
it was her nature to heal those in need and she had n't realized the danger until the imp refused to leave her foster mother 's farm , his desperate attempts to please her causing complete chaos until she 'd finally figured out how to release him .
she 'd spent the majority of her life on a small farm in the remote outback of australia before being captured by the mage and hidden in siberia .

` ` the first memories i have are of living on a farm in australia with my foster mother , '' she grudgingly revealed .
her gaze skimmed over the passing fields and distant farm homes that slumbered beneath the moonlight .
allowing jaelyn to lead them to a small town settled between a patchwork of farms , tane wrapped himself in shadows as they moved across the small park in the center of town .
but busy nuzzling the tender skin of his throat and rubbing her hands down the clenched muscles of his back , she appeared suitably occupied as he at last reached the remote farm and charged into the empty house .
thankful for her immortality , nefri watched the landscape flash by , catching only blurred glimpses of tangled wetlands that eventually gave way to small farms , with the occasional town huddled in the soft glow of streetlights .

the couple who owns the raspberry farm is long - time friends of bill and lorrie 's , and the kids will get to spend the day helping out , not just with the raspberries but also the cows , chickens , sheep , goats , and beehives .

it was right after claudia took him from the farm and i helped stopped her from making a slave out of him .
i was just at the farm !
` ` on the farm with gavin , i suspect . ''
a tall , solid body from physical farm work , his arms are muscular and the tight tee he wears does nothing to hide the fact he 's strong .
whether she was dancing on stage or getting dirty with the pigs on the farm she shared with her husband , grayson , people simply could n't take their eyes off her .
having lived in northern california her entire life , lori figured she must have driven through there at some point , but as far as she could recall , pescadero had been nothing more than a bunch of farms strung together .
` ` i just love the green rolling hills that seem to go on forever , all those sheep and cows munching away , and the fact that the ocean is at the end of nearly every farm road . ''
a sleepy farm town was the last place she would ever have thought to pick for an impromptu vacation .
wearing cowboy boots and well - worn blue jeans , they both fit perfectly into the farm town .
who knew how much longer she 'd be out driving these farm roads before she found a place to stay for the night ?
on second glance , the general store was pretty cute inside , a little farm ` ` superstore '' with groceries and clothes and chicken feed , clearly all of equal importance to the people who lived here .
the storefronts dripped with old western charm and she 'd even passed a farm stand that looked like a picture out of a magazine .
not for one second of her life had she ever thought about living or working on a farm .
not to try to please anyone else , but to please herself , and to know that at the end of a long day on the farm , she 'd done good work that she could be proud of .
she grinned and asked , ` ` can you tell me how to get to his farm ? ''
when he 'd bought this pescadero farm three years ago , the barn had been on the verge of becoming firewood and the farmhouse had been a mice - infested shell .
a hundred and fifty years ago the first farmer had started to work this land and it 'd had a good run for a while , but the latest generation had been more interested in their fancy cars and ipos than the farm their grandfather had spent his life cultivating .
grayson had spent seven days a week for the past three years bringing the farm back to life .
that was one of the great things about a farm : the past did n't matter .
what was a woman doing at his farm ?
and those legs ... even though she was n't particularly tall they went on forever , ending in spike heels that had no place whatsoever on a farm .
` ` what experience do you have working on a farm ? ''
` ` you 're telling me that you 're going to get to work on my farm in those ? ''
and she had to admit her heels were n't exactly the best footwear for a muddy , gravelly , grassy farm , as the spikes kept getting stuck in the sod .
his heart would have to stop before he could ignore the fact that he had a live , in the flesh , pin - up girl on his farm .
and for the past thirty - six months , his farm in pescadero had been his refuge from the past , from ever having to think about what had happened to his wife ... or his role in it .
i just want a job working on your farm . ''
but while he did n't believe for a minute that working on a farm had been her lifelong dream , at least he felt fairly confident that she did n't have an angry guy on her tail .
grayson , fortunately , was n't a particularly messy man , which was surprising , considering how much dirt there was all around him on his farm .
then again , he 'd been so grumpy from the moment she showed up on his farm that it was more than a little tempting to mess with him like that .
now , as he looked at the bright flowers stitched on the napkins , he remembered that they were a farm - warming gift from the family whose property adjoined his .
but he had n't asked her to come to his farm .
the urge to stroke his hand over her cheek to find out if her skin was as soft there as it was on her hands made his voice more gruff than it needed to be as he told her , ` ` the day starts early here on the farm .
the farm animals would n't care what she looked like .
the natural beauty of his farm was breathtaking , but once she caught sight of him , she could n't pull her gaze away .
` ` i 'd love to know more about your farm . ''
people go to his farm once a week to pick up their food . ''
` ` but in the article i read , '' lori said with honest confusion , ` ` it sounded like the farmers sell directly from their own farms , and most of them even have barn stores where people can drop in throughout the week if they need something extra . ''
no doubt grayson was simply too busy running the farm and producing the food for his csa to find those extra hours for the weekly community pick - ups .
` ` now that i ' m here , i could run the pick - up days so you do n't have to have your friend do it on his farm . ''
maybe she 'd been wrong about life on a farm being so isolating .
` ` i could even open a farm store for you ! ''
fortunately , he would have bet his farm that she was going to hate dealing with the pigs , with all their mud and mess - and their surprising intelligence .
who knew working on a farm could be so crazy ?
not , he told himself , because he missed seeing her since breakfast , but because letting her work on his farm was like keeping a box of fireworks next to a roaring fire - you never knew when one little spark was going to light off the whole damned thing .
with every passing second that she remained on his farm , he could feel her not just getting under his skin , but going even deeper .
the trip to the general store from his farm took about fifteen minutes , and she figured a quarter hour was easily long enough to get a little revenge for the way he 'd acted in the pigpen .
facing him rather than the beautiful view of the sweeping green fields outside , she asked , ` ` were you related to the people you bought the farm from ? ''
` ` did you own a different farm somewhere else before you got this one ? ''
` ` it 's a good four miles to either my farm or the general store from here . ''
realizing how her question sounded , she said , ` ` not that i do n't think it takes a lot of brains to run a big farm like yours .
` ` so if you have a degree in finance from one of the best universities in the country and only bought your farm three years ago , what were you doing for all the time in between ? ''
this small farm town she 'd chosen to visit on a whim could n't be further from the skyscrapers and busy traffic in the windy city .
` ` i ' m working on a farm . ''
lori could easily picture her sister 's stunned expression as she repeated , ` ` a farm ? ''
` ` how could you have possibly ended up on a farm ? ''
` ` back to the farm ? ''
` ` back to the farm . ''
` ` you 'd better call me every day with an update on how you 're doing , '' her sister warned her , ` ` because i ' m going to worry every second until i hear from you again , and if i do n't know you 're okay , i ' m going to have to come after you , whether you want me there on that farm with you or not . ''
and while lori had n't given too much away to the other woman , she had made it clear that she was on his farm to get a break from her real life ... and she had promised to head back to it in a ` ` little while . ''
somehow he needed to hold his focus on the farm , on the never - ending work that came with owning a thousand acres and more than a hundred animals .
and if she was , then what the hell was she doing on his farm pretending to be a farmhand when she should be up on a stage somewhere ?
she 'd been fearless everywhere else on his farm , but she never ventured too close to his horses .
or did it have nothing to do with him at all and she simply missed her family ... or whoever else she had run from to come to his farm ?
grayson could n't stand the thought of anyone poking into his past , not when he could guess how fast the story would turn from one about his farm and csa into a ` ` tragic '' story of love and loss .
would n't it be great to go zipping down the farm road in the middle of the night , under a full moon , pedal to the metal ? ''
lori had always loved helping marcus out with his vineyard in napa , but even so , she was surprised by how much she liked working on a farm , with the exception of cleaning bathrooms .
maybe , she thought yet again , she was right to have come here to a farm miles from anyone she knew , from anything she 'd ever experienced .
out here on grayson 's farm was the first time in her adult life that she 'd ever forgone a blow dryer or let her skin be bared to the sun without at least mascara and blush and lipstick .
` ` you 're going to be even more useless on the farm if you get sick . ''
a terrible weakness that had been eating away at him one second , one minute , one hour at a time over the past few days since she 'd invaded his space , his farm .
she 'd sworn never to beg him for anything , that she 'd earn with hard work every day on his farm and every night in the bedroom he 'd given her .
because he 'd recognized in her the need to heal that had been in himself three years ago when he 'd found the farm .
and yet , even though he 'd lived with her for nearly a week , and even though she 'd just come apart in his arms and it had been one of the most beautiful things he 'd ever experienced in thirty - five years , he still did n't know a damn thing about why she was on the farm .
` ` i want to know why you came here with the want ad in your fist when you 'd clearly never set foot on a farm a day in your life . ''
you do n't want me on your farm .
we need to get back to the farm to make sure the rest of the animals are okay . ''
` ` but i think the reason i ended up here , on your farm , was n't because i needed to learn to be a farmhand .
she turned to walk out on him , but before she could leave him to stew in his own misery until kingdom come , he said , ` ` instead of pestering me with your questions , you should be asking yourself what the hell you 're doing hiding on my farm .
she could go work on someone else 's farm .
she 'd been about to leave to save what was left of her heart , but now she knew that , no matter how much it hurt to be near grayson , she needed to stay for the one true friend she 'd made on his farm .
especially when she 'd told him that she 'd come to his farm to take a break not only from dancing , but also from men .
and yet , even though she knew she could have left his farm at any moment , somehow that had n't been an option .
` ` i ' ve been alone on this farm long enough that people are starting to think i ' m fair game .
` ` i ' ve let you hide out here on my farm all week , that 's why . ''
the vision of making love to lori while she was wearing nothing but those red spike heels would n't go away as they drove from his farm to his neighbor 's property fifteen minutes away .
and yet , they had n't had a single visitor on the farm in the week she 'd been working for him .
between having to finally face what a total douchebag her ex was , and then the trials of not only learning to work grayson 's farm , but also trying to push away her intense attraction to him , she was left holding on to an extremely short string .
when she 'd been line dancing , she 'd felt like she belonged , that she was n't just some city girl playing around on a farm .
not if she wanted even one small piece of her heart to remain intact when she finally left his farm to go back to her real life .
it was just that he was such a part of the land , such a cowboy at heart , had such a love for the farm , that she kept forgetting about his previous life in new york city .
he also knew that keeping her hidden away on his farm for more than a stolen week or two would unfairly deprive the world of her truly special gifts .
his farm .
` ` fifteen minutes , that was all we needed to get back to my farm .
to grayson 's farm .
* * * minutes felt more like hours as grayson forced himself to take the dark farm roads just barely above the speed limit .
grayson knew he should n't have let her stay on his farm all week , and that he definitely should n't be taking her to his bed now .
` ` time for you to come again , farm girl , '' he said as he yanked her back up his body .
` ` please , '' she begged him , his strong , dancing farm girl entirely lost to sensation .
for the very first time in her life , she actually felt whole ; as if she 'd needed to date and mess up with other men and relationships all these years just so that she could finally come around to this farm in the middle of nowhere and find the one man who truly mattered .
chapter twenty the next few days passed in a blur of back - breaking hard work as lori helped grayson lay in the boards and beams for the new roof of his cottage while keeping up with all of the usual farm chores .
a dream would never be so heartless , or make her muscles ache quite so much with his incredibly long lists of work to be done on the farm .
because once she re - entered her real life , she 'd see how ridiculous hiding out on his farm was .
as much a part of the land as she seemed to be every time he looked at her , the truth was that she did n't belong on his farm .
and he would have to let her leave anyway , because keeping lori hidden away on a farm would deprive the world of her truly special gift .
` ` they must be so amazed with your farm , with everything you ' ve done here to make such a difference in feeding an entire community . ''
they 'd want to know everything , and she knew she 'd have to tell them about her ex , the farm , the work she 'd done these past two weeks .
his heart broke as he finally lost the furry friend who had been with him every step of the way as he built a new life on the farm .
i tried to get her to go back home , but she would n't leave my farm . ''
so much that even though there was nothing more he wanted than to keep her holed up with him on his farm until they were old and gray , he knew he had to set her free .
but they could n't hide out on his farm forever .
` ` i ' m not quitting after all , because grayson helped me realize that i do love it - while i ' ve spent the last couple of weeks on his farm being a farmhand . ''
the women , for the most part , were far more welcoming as they asked him questions about his farm , while her brothers continued to treat him as though he was on probation .
of course , marcus was just as stubborn as she was , so instead of agreeing , he said , ` ` tell me more about the farm . ''
` ` but he lives on a thousand - acre farm and runs a csa that supports an entire community .
` ` can you really see lori living on a farm ? ''
` ` i ' m sure being out on a farm is fun for a week or two - something different , especially after what happened in chicago .
` ` but while i ' m gone , i do n't want to leave you on the farm by yourself . ''
` ` now that you ' ve whipped my farm into shape and taught everyone in pescadero how to line dance just like they do it in nashville , it 's time to go show that idiot in chicago what you 're made of . ''
when she suddenly pulled back , her eyes were dry and filled with the resolve and determination that he 'd seen on the farm every time he 'd challenged her - and she 'd challenged him right back .
` ` before i head off for chicago and you go back to your farm to feed your chickens , i think that i should teach you a new dance . ''
he 'd even pushed her to return to her own world despite his obvious belief that she would n't come back to him , back to the farm .
* * * grayson had never been happier about all the things that could go wrong on a farm .
not when every single thing on his farm reminded him of lori .
your basic average dream day on a farm . ''
` ` i want so badly to come back to you and the farm the second the show is over , but ... '' another pause came and he had to grab a kitchen chair and sit down to brace himself for it .
the sky was full of dark clouds that looked as if they would burst with rain at any moment , the gray , cold sky so different from the clear blue over his farm .
he 'd needed to start over in a world that was as far from new york society as possible , so he 'd gone west and , just like lori in her rental car , had stumbled onto his farm .
even now , he could feel her protecting him , his fierce and beautiful dancing farm girl who had the biggest heart of anyone he 'd ever known .
i ' m in california now , on a farm .
once they were sitting on stools at a tiny booth with dripping , steaming slices of pizza in front of them , he told her , ` ` i never thought i could be in the middle of new york city and my farm at the same time .
chapter twenty - six grayson did n't know if he 'd ever get used to being with a woman so beautiful that she turned heads everywhere they went , and so friendly that half the people on the plane home from new york now had an invitation to come visit the farm .
grayson kept an eye out for oncoming traffic on the two - lane farm road as he went to her .
for the rest of the drive , she chattered to the kitten - whom he swore he 'd never , ever call milliebob , even as he knew he 'd be breaking the vow by week 's end - telling the little cat all about the farm and the other animals and how much she was going to love it there .
` ` seriously , though , '' she said when he finally let her come up for air and her synapses had begun to fire again , ` ` you 're amazing for agreeing to have so many people here on your farm . ''
` ` not my farm .
our farm . ''
` ` your farm is amazing , '' nicola said as she handed lori a glass of champagne and led her over to an empty chair .
and the farm had been the perfect place to host it .
but she 'd broken that rule on this farm in pescadero again and again .
the three of them were over by the barn looking at the pigs , and emma was clearly delighted by the farm animals .
even if the front bumper was n't half smashed to pieces by the white farm fence she 'd slid into , her bald tires were n't going to get any traction on the mud .
opened a door , which creaked in the friendly way farm doors do , and stepped inside .
eased the truck onto a dirt road , its surface wide and even , perfectly suited for horse trailers and farm equipment .
people do n't want to be associated with a farm that 's considered controversial . ''
even a fifteen - year - old farm boy knew that if your heart was n't pumping , your brain and vital organs were going to starve no matter how many deep breaths you took .
except then it came back to her as she picked the thing out of the mismatched coins ... that garage out in the farm country .
turning in at the signage marked hunterbred farms , he was on autopilot as his truck wound around the various horse breed - referenced streets , passing identical stacked buildings that were painted dark green and gold and had central staircases open to the air .
there was a truck parked next to her , a rough , rangy vehicle that seemed like it belonged more in farm and forest territory than at a city - dweller cafe .
it was a small farm , surrounded by huge farms .
it was a small farm , surrounded by huge farms .
instead of being in search of a hair salon , though , she was out in the boonies , driving along rural roads that were not marked , in search of a farm .
` ` we lived out on a farm .

most farms out there , the women labor in the house , you know - and that 's a lot of work .
a farm in iowa was going to be my slide into middle age .

although at least he had n't sunk to farm animal level .
the rickety fence in the headlights was the kind of thing you 'd see on a cattle farm - that had been deserted .
` ` hmm , i 'd rather you sing about cows and pigs on a farm . ''
i ' m sure his parents would only have gotten sharecropper jobs or work on some farm . ''
` ` i was going to say you sound like a sweet , innocent farm girl . ''
` ` so , lucky , please tell me , what farm did you come from ? ''
` ` the tobacco farm , duh . ''
` ` what , not the cotton farm ? ''
it did n't fit my image of my mother ; i could n't see her in a farmhouse or on a farm .
for all i knew she was on a ranch somewhere in texas , servicing some rancher on a cattle farm .
` ` shall we go to a farm ? ''
sometimes it 's the faithful farm boy who 's always been by her side , through thick and thin .
that 's what you folks say on the farm right . ''
` ` the farm ? ''
` ` oh , you 're not from a farm . ''
` ` you thought i was from a farm ? ''
maybe a farm ? ''
` ` i bought leland 's christmas tree farm a few months ago , so i was on my way up there . ''
` ` so you were going to the farm when you picked up these boys . ''
leland faust , who owned a farm near big fork since he 'd married bella wagoner , was the other .
she told him her husband was already out on the farm but supplied his cell phone number .
after she graduated , david opened his state farm office and they both came back to pine view , where they 'd lived on david 's parents ' property until tug finished building her house .
he 'd probably be at her farm this weekend , helping improve the place , if callie was n't on her honeymoon .
despite all the critters that scurried around the place after dark , he had n't awakened her like this once in the three months since she 'd moved to the farm .
everyone knew that this was the vanetta farm , that the aging theona and herbert had died within months of each other and she was living here alone .
but since moving to the farm , and knowing she was probably facing the end of her life , callie had been so terribly lonely she 'd slipped back into sleeping with kyle a few times .
that gives me a chance to live here , on the farm , like i ' ve always wanted to , before my parents sell it .
* * * at the farm , the sun bore down on levi , reminding him of kandahar in july .
he liked the farm .
` ` while you work out here , taking pictures of nature and getting the farm in shape . ''
and when they searched the farm they could n't find him anywhere .
he was referring to the fact that she had a guest at the farm .
` ` i think having a man on the farm might be a good thing . ''
fortunately , he was the only state farm agent in whiskey creek and had a very loyal clientele .
that 's what you said when you moved out to the farm .
and it 's taking time and effort to put the farm to rights . ''
she came back to that again and again , even though the amount of care a farm required did n't make owning one very practical for someone who did n't plan to work it .
but levi 's lived at the farm for three days .
and i need his help on the farm .
she 'd needed to distract herself so she could calm down and get her emotions under control before returning to the farm .
` ` do your parents know you have a stranger staying with you at the farm ? ''
but she was determined to battle through the fatigue for the sake of the farm .
callie was afraid it would destroy the entire farm .
it was important to her that the farm survive and go on , even if she did n't .
and i like being at the farm .
the truck denny had driven to the farm sat in the driveway .
` ` i know you started the fire at the farm night before last . ''
` ` because she 's getting the farm ready to put on the market , '' kyle explained .
` ` we know she has some guy staying at the farm with her . ''
she was feeling better , wanted to go back to the farm .
` ` i guess that levi fellow who 's been staying at the farm is at his place . ''
* * * levi was anxious to return to the farm .
we 'll be at the farm tomorrow .
callie did n't own the farm , and her parents would be selling it soon .
he 'd reached the farm but was still sitting astride his bike .
first the farm .
` ` maybe she really has been preoccupied with getting the farm up for sale , '' cheyenne whispered back .
riley and kyle had left with eve in her 1994 mercedes convertible , so they had n't heard the bomb dylan had dropped just as they turned out of the farm 's driveway .
when there was no answer , they wanted to return to the farm to see what was going on , but he talked them into letting him go alone .
he 'd been out to the farm more than anyone else .
` ` sometimes i think i am in love with you , '' he muttered as he punched the gas pedal and barreled down the country road to the farm .
once she told her parents about her illness , her time at the farm was over .
her parents had given him the key to the farm , so he was staying there and taking care of rifle .
callie wished more than anything that she could go home with him and see her dog , but at least the two of them got to stay at the farm for a while longer .
callie imagined moving back to the farm and taking up where they 'd left off .
* * * the farm was n't the same without callie .
i told most of the others the day i recognized you at the farm . ''
still , the day she returned to the farm was one of the best of her life .
turning it off , she pulled down the tree - lined dirt road that led to the neighbors ' farm and stopped just beyond eve 's house .
she wanted to call joe , ask him what had gone wrong at the tree farm , why that guy had upset him .
he would never abandon his flock , his farm , his family .
she did n't want to go to the farm where clay and allie lived , anyway .
my stepmother inherited the farm , but she 'd never hurt a soul . ''
` ` and you 'll drive ... '' ` ` my stepbrother will let me borrow a truck from the farm .
clay clenched his jaw as he imagined his stepfather standing at the window of that office , watching carefully to be sure the farm chores were done to his specifications .
when madeline was little , ray had even worked for them , doing odd jobs around the farm .
they 'd had to constantly defend themselves , suffer two police searches of the farm , endure the distrust of almost everyone in town and tolerate whispering behind their backs .
he 'd lived on the farm alone and come to town once or twice a week for supplies or a game of pool at the billiards hall .
last night , aunt elaine had been chasing her around the farm with a knife , yelling , ` ` how dare you be disloyal to your own father !
she did it while he was out working on the farm .
he had the farm my stepbrother now owns , a good job , modest savings .
` ` i thought your stepmother inherited the farm . ''
he 'd made a note of it when they talked on the phone the first time she 'd called because the farm might ' ve provided the stepmother with a motive for murder .
` ` ran the farm , worked odd jobs in town , anything he had to do , really .
that 's why my stepmother turned the farm over to him . ''
she was new , and we lived away from town , on a farm . ''
the animals on the farm ?
the farm itself ?
i was hoping you could take me out to the farm . ''
` ` what about the farm ? ''
she even helped out at the farm occasionally . ''
he neglected the repairs and painting at the farm , but he stayed right on top of his church work .
` ` if your father was trying to help them out , why not hire ray to do some of the repairs around the farm ? ''
the farm 's on the other side of town , off the highway . ''
` ` well , after that , we had a couple of bad years with the farm , he had me to take care of , and people around here were struggling so he was n't making as much at the church .
chapter eleven the farm was bigger than hunter had expected .
` ` i want to show hunter the farm , anyway , '' she said .
some farm equipment was clustered beyond that , as well as a couple of rusted trucks that seemed to hail from the 1950s .
` ` pretty soon the farm will be his hobby . ''
after my father disappeared and clay came back from college and took over the farm , he ripped out the stalls and converted it into a garage . ''
instead , he crossed to the window and gazed out , trying to see the farm as barker would ' ve seen it .
madeline hated having to bring hunter to the farm .
he had a study at the church , but it was easier to maintain the farm if he worked out here . ''
she did n't want him to leave , although there were moments she was absolutely terrified - like back at the farm , when clay was glaring at hunter and she was seeing her stepbrother through hunter 's eyes .
because irene had been so busy helping clay earn a living and save the farm , and grace had been so remote , madeline had taken care of the youngest montgomery .
madeline was n't any happier about taking hunter to see grace than she 'd been about going to the farm .
madeline noticed that his actions were very casual and unthreatening , a far different hunter than the one who 'd visited the farm .
` ` did n't mr . harper come to the farm often ? ''
work on the farm ?
chief jenkins : did your stepfather spend much time with you on the farm ?
montgomery : i could n't take them off the farm .
clay was out on the farm quite a lot , out of their sight .
images of where her father might be buried at the farm .
the farm seemed to be deserted .
he 'd owned this farm .
glancing nervously around , he jumped into the driver 's seat and drove away from the farm as slowly and comfortably as if he 'd just stopped by for a visit .
no , she 'd been at the farm .
right now they 're searching the barns at some of the outlying farms .
it 's here at the farm .
when she stopped at the farm and he realized everyone was gone , it was simply too good an opportunity to pass up .
` ` my stepfather 's office at the farm , or his office at the church . ''
it 'd probably been taken in the office at the farm .
the only part she 'd leave out concerned grace and the accident at the farm .
mom gave me that stuff when she moved away from the farm .
but that did n't stop them -- and others -- from constantly poking around his farm , asking questions , suggesting scenarios , attempting to piece together the past in hopes of solving the biggest mystery stillwater had ever known .
` ` that 's the montgomery farm . ''
and what reason , good or otherwise , could barker have had to abandon his farm ?
gravel spun as she arrived at the farm and whipped into the long driveway .
the long grueling hours he worked maintaining a farm that should have taken two or more people to run kept him in shape .
allie flipped off the interior light and considered the quiet farm .
although allie had n't become fully aware of his existence until the scandal broke , there were plenty of folks who remembered him from when he 'd first come to town , right after the widowed reverend married irene and moved her little family from neighboring booneville to the farm .
that was why he stayed on the farm .
bonnie ray simpson says she saw him pull into the farm at about the same time .
he imagined hearing a little girl 's laughter in the house , or taking his son out on the farm .
surely by now he 'd heard about the call she 'd handled at the montgomery farm -- from hendricks or someone he 'd told , from the rumors beth ann had probably started , from the dispatcher .
maybe it was nineteen years old , but it was still very present in the minds of so many -- reverend barker 's daughter and extended family , the montgomerys , jed fowler , who 'd fixed the tractor at the farm the night it all happened , reverend portenski , who 'd taken over for barker at the church , and reverend barker 's whole congregation .
` ` what do you suppose she was doing at the farm in the middle of the night with a flashlight and a shovel ? ''
joe marked the spot where grace was digging , then we took a backhoe to clay 's farm .
the farm ?
if he 'd killed barker and buried him at the farm , that would explain it .
when he returned from college , she 'd moved into town and let him take over at the farm .
the moment we sell the farm , the police will get the new owner 's permission to search , and they 'll go over every inch . ''
` ` i thought you might want to know that i already heard what happened at the farm night before last . ''
joe had instigated the last search of the farm .
and now she was happy , and clay was going to make damn sure she stayed that way , if he had to sit at the farm and guard whatever forensic evidence remained until he rotted right along with barker .
another week she 'd written about the way he managed ` ` a large , successful farm '' all on his own , as if there 'd never been a better farmer .
he could n't bring a woman -- a wife -- to the farm and expect her to fight the same negative sentiments he did , could n't claim her heart and then leave her husbandless if the truth ever came out .
because grace never stayed at the farm very long , he decided he 'd get to see more of her if he waited until she left to start that routine .
he would n't have remained at the farm , either , except that he had no other choice .
he 'd grown too used to rambling around the farm by himself .
standing , she dropped a quick kiss on his cheek , and he knew she 'd already stayed at the farm as long as she could tolerate .
considering the call she made from your farm , she tends to vacillate . ''
he 'd been at the farm the night barker disappeared ; he 'd also attempted to confess to barker 's murder nine months ago , during the last police search .
` ` in the reports , you said barker did n't come back to the farm that night . ''
if allie was right about jed 's motivation for his strange and sudden confession at the farm -- if it was true that he carried a torch for the attractive irene montgomery and had been trying to protect her -- he 'd be able to give her this information .
and yet he 'd confessed when he thought barker 's remains had been discovered at the farm ... . ` ` according to what i ' ve been told , nine months ago you tried to take responsibility for the murder of reverend barker .
pushing the end button on her cell phone , she decided to try again later and slowed to turn into the property across from clay 's farm .
but as she looked over at the farm , wondering where clay might have gone , she spotted the back end of his truck parked slightly behind the house .
` ` see you at eight - thirty , '' he said and went back inside as if he did n't care whether she rambled around the farm .
like his mother , he worked at the farm and took whatever odd jobs he could find .
he 'd run the farm and picked up various part - time jobs .
allie yawned , guessing that instant alertness came from a lifetime of standing vigil over the farm .
` ` the farm 's looking nice .
` ` clay told me he buried the body right there on the farm . ''
he assumed she 'd gone to clay 's farm , and she planned to leave it that way .
she still suspected he was the one who 'd driven by the farm the other day , when she was peeking in the window of barker 's old office .
he 'd also invited her to the farm , so she 'd have company , but she 'd declined .
fear said if she lowered her defenses and she was wrong , he could kill her , bury her in the woods and drive back to town as if he 'd never even left the farm -- and no one would be the wiser .
he stared at her from beneath his thick lashes , and she got the impression that he was trying to figure her out , like that first night at his farm .
at the farm ? ''
chapter 14 turning off his headlights , chief mccormick sat at the side of the road and studied the farm where clay montgomery lived .
braking for the light at fourth and main , he glanced to the left , which led to his farm , then to the right , which would take him to the trailer park where beth ann lived .
allie tapped the steering wheel with her fingernails while she waited at the next light , eager to reach clay 's farm .
` ` clay mortgaged the farm to be able to clean the place up and do some repairs , but it 's been several years since he did that and it was n't a large note to begin with .
what about the farm ? ''
` ` she 'll be staying at the farm ? ''
she wo n't stay at the farm alone . ''
coming in from the farm to sleep with her at night .
she wo n't be at the farm .
he was too focused on what he was about to do -- which , as far as she could tell , was search clay 's farm .
he must have some reason for protecting the farm as vigilantly as he did .
she 'd tried contacting grace and madeline while she was on the road , to ask them to meet her at the farm .
the farm looked deserted .
the farm was far enough from town that joe and whoever was with him would ' ve had to drive .
she had to get her father and irene away from the farm .
if allie had her guess , it was only a matter of time until joe began to fight for another search of the farm , saying that her father had purposely avoided the barn when they were digging there before .
it was n't as if he was getting much sleep when he was constantly worrying about allie and his family and what might be happening at the farm .
she 'd gone to clay 's farm for privacy .
joe 's goals in coming to the farm would have nothing to do with her purse .
i sent kennedy over to make sure the farm was secure , and he saw your car in the driveway . ''
it was molly who answered the door when allie arrived at the farm .
but allie liked the scent of damp earth and confederate jasimine that embraced her at the farm .
it was too late the night beth ann called me to the farm . ''
but if allie brought whitney to the farm and let her meet him ... she opened her mouth to say she 'd think about it .
allie backed out of the driveway and headed toward town , but once she knew her taillights could no longer be seen from the farm , she pulled off onto the shoulder and sat staring into the darkness all around her .
to clay 's farm .
` ` so why did n't the police find barker 's remains when they searched the farm ? ''
he could never leave the farm , or stillwater .
` ` after what you did at the farm , she was willing to speak to you ? ''
he -- he 's always in town or at the farm . ''
he had n't been interested in making himself accessible to people ; he was usually at the farm , anyway .
` ` if they 're at the farm , move them , '' she said .
he did n't respond immediately , but then he said , ` ` you can have the farm .
but considering what the police were likely to find when they searched the farm , it might be worth the risk .
clay could hardly believe that it was all over , that he 'd be able to remain on the farm where he belonged .
grace thought it was because evonne had an inkling of what had gone on at the farm , knew without ever being told .
maybe she was n't too excited about what lurked at the farm .
she 'd spent her first year after high school helping their mother move from the farm and get settled in town .
` ` from what i heard , you stopped by the farm night before last .
the reverend had only a modest living and the farm .
` ` she got the farm , did n't she ?
half the town would tear the farm apart searching for lee barker .
we already know that jed was at the farm that night , working on the tractor . ''
he would n't leave mom , you , clay , molly , the farm , his congregation .
she kept picturing the gullies formed by the runoff , the water moving the topsoil at the farm , dumping it into the irrigation ditches and washing it far away from the trees behind the barn .
you 're still guarding that damn farm .
go away ... . ` ` maybe i 'll take a backhoe to that farm you used to live on , see what i can come up with , '' he yelled .
` ` last night joe vincelli came over , threatening to take a backhoe to the farm . ''
` ` the police searched the farm , and they did n't find anything .
` ` clay ca n't live on that farm forever .
he had n't graduated from high school because he 'd had to run the cotton farm on which his family lived - and he 'd had to work at the gas station in town when he was n't on the farm .
he had n't graduated from high school because he 'd had to run the cotton farm on which his family lived - and he 'd had to work at the gas station in town when he was n't on the farm .
vicki nibley would n't have a prayer if you were responsible for figuring out what went on at the farm that night . ''
` ` fix it so i can take a backhoe to the farm and dig around .
` ` the police searched the farm .
she 'd grabbed her car keys and driven straight to the farm .
` ` we 'll say you 're making a few improvements to the farm .
they had to hide them deep in the woods and let joe search the farm .
` ` just like your mother was n't after my uncle 's farm .
but being at the farm was too difficult .
i ' m sort of partial to my flower farm , you know ? ''
but he did n't get more than a block from clay 's farm before he made a u - turn and headed back to town .
a find like that would , no doubt , lead to another search of the farm .
joe stayed at the window long enough to make sure she turned left toward the farm .
the deep croak of a toad broke the silence as she crossed the cotton fields toward the farm .
she could n't live in stillwater another day knowing that proof of what had happened was right on the farm , exactly where so many people suspected it to be .
she would ' ve taken a circuitous route , too , except there was only one way to get to the farm from town .
` ` i just saw her heading toward the farm . ''
the farm .
grace had talked about the farm .
the phone at the farm rang and rang and rang .
i ' m on my way to the montgomery farm . ''
` ` but you already searched the farm !
` ` meet me at the farm as soon as possible .
his family dragged him off as grace looked at the farm , waiting for her memories of the reverend to steal the light from her soul , to dim her happiness , the way they always did .
they 'd claim mccormick purposely turned a blind eye to any possible evidence when he searched the farm , which would put them right back under the microscope .
and , fortunately , he lived in turlock out in the sparsely populated boondocks among the dairies , orchards and tomato farms south of sacramento .
` ` used to be a dairy farm , '' david explained .
none of them could afford to bring the farm back .
a helicopter would never be able to land in the wooded area where he lived , but he could meet the airlift at the jensen farm just outside of town , like he had for that camper who 'd had a heart attack two years ago .
he 'd probably bought it from ron piper , who owned a farm on the outskirts of town .
sure enough , it bore the piper farms label .
dundee , idaho reenie slowed as she passed the small farm for sale a few miles from her home .
` ` mom loves that farm , silly , '' she said .
she 'd tried to convince keith that the higley farm would be a wonderful place to raise their girls .
he was n't the type to remodel or farm , he told her .
but she 'd thought the farm might eventually provide a way for him to settle down and stay in one place .
maybe she and keith would n't make a mint with their little farm , but he was n't earning all that much right now .
at least with the farm they 'd be together .
she was going to talk to keith about the higley farm .
` ` i want to buy the higley farm , '' she said .
` ` it 's a broken - down old farm .
i ' ve been wanting to buy this farm , and ... well ... '' her bottom lip came out in a quick pout that reminded him once again of her youngest daughter .
buy you the farm as soon as i get there .
i 'll quit my job right now , buy you the farm .
i said we 'd buy the farm , do anything you want . ''
her father had even agreed to help her buy the farm , and to let her pay him back over the next several years .
` ` when will you be moving to the farm ? ''
fortunately , she had the holidays , her new job and her move to the farm to keep her busy .
since moving to the farm , she had a horse , a cow and several chickens to care for and therefore had to make frequent trips .
between milking the cow in the morning , teaching school during the day and taking care of the kids and the farm at night , she usually dropped into bed around midnight and did n't even dream .
and , largely due to gabe 's help , the most rudimentary improvements to the farm , including the repairs to the barn , were complete .
but he thought she had to be crazy to take on the farm and so many animals when her life was so upside down .
maybe you should sell your horse and cow and forget about fixing up the farm for a while . ''
you wanted the farm , you have it .
he kept picturing isaac and reenie at the farm alone , imagining what they might be doing right now .
keith had tried to call her several times already , had even stopped by the farm again after isaac had left that night , and then the next day .
with the farm and her job and her girls , she had more than she could handle already .
even for the fact that living at the farm was nothing like she 'd imagined it when she 'd pictured buying the property with keith .
maybe life at the farm was lonely , and maybe isaac made her heart race , but he 'd never give up his research for anyone .
he 'd actually been able to see himself living at the farm , painting the barn , riding horses with the girls , going to thanksgiving dinner at the holbrooks .
liz had seen her brother 's truck parked in a variety of places but never in front of reenie 's farm .
she 'd already used work and the farm half a dozen or more times to avoid get - togethers over the past month .
if i can live without reenie 's laugh and the girls and spike and the farm ... a flight attendant walked to the podium near his gate and began to call for boarding .
she wanted to press him for details , but as they turned into the farm , their headlights swung across the snow - covered lawn and she saw someone sitting on the porch swing , hunched against the cold .
she told him she grew up on a farm with fresh fruit and vegetables and long days spent playing in the barn .
` ` they do n't own a large farm ? ''
` ` they do n't own a farm .
and they ' ve certainly never owned a farm . ''
` ` you 're definitely correct there , miss delaney from jerome with the big family living on the farm with the fresh milk and all that other bullshit , '' he said .
the blazing july sun , bouncing off the sea of car carcasses , bent bicycle frames , even obsolete farm equipment , made her feel as if she was trapped in an oven instead of running down a lead on the outskirts of prescott , arizona .
they 're eventually going to inherit a sizeable farm right outside of bordertown . ''
as much as he hated his father , this was home , the only home he 'd known until his mother had died and some other farm laborer had moved into her shack .
circumventing the nicer vehicles and farm equipment stored near a large silver water tank and a grain bin , he took the narrow road that led along the fence to the living quarters for the field help .
he had n't wanted to incite her anger for fear she 'd have his mother kicked off the farm .
did he really earn such a great living from selling hay and other animal supplies and renting farm equipment ?
a lot of farm laborers come in .
the ranchers depended on those early hours ; that was when they rented most of the farm equipment , which meant gary went to bed early ... .
she went through his drawers until she came across the plastic container that held all the keys to the farm equipment and drew out the only one that was n't marked .
he probably makes five times as much through his illegal activities as he does renting farm equipment and selling feed .
` ` sorry , '' his father said again , and started driving toward the central clearing , where all the farm equipment waited for a sunrise that would be anything but ordinary , when only two dunlap men awoke on the farm .
` ` sorry , '' his father said again , and started driving toward the central clearing , where all the farm equipment waited for a sunrise that would be anything but ordinary , when only two dunlap men awoke on the farm .
they passed the farm equipment and took the side road along the fence in the opposite direction from the laborers ' shacks .
or an acre of the farm .
stuart probably got a lot of his resentment from edna , but the superiority he felt was n't unusual among farm owners .
i 'll drive you to the house and give you the keys to one of the farm trucks .
she gazed around , noting the chiricahua mountains in the distance , the farms in between and the heavy ranching influence .
lots were everywhere in the mountains of north carolina - this was christmas - tree - farm country , after all - so to distinguish themselves , the drummonds offered friendliness and tradition and atmosphere .
` ` so where 's the family farm ? ''
there were tons of tree farms up there , just north of the city .
i had to go back to eating meat , because i needed that level of protein and energy for the farm work .
my grandparents started our tree farm . ''
they want me to take over the farm , but my sister is the one who actually wants it .
` ` the farm barely turns a profit as it is .
lana comes out of the kitchen with some pepperidge farm cookies thrown on a plate and a glass of milk .
the campus was pastoral , surrounded by farms and woodlands .
with neve , they 'd been part of the batch of kids brought here twelve years back : plague orphans from the failed colony , bought cheap and worked hard , the boys in the field , the girls in the factory , their food thin and their beds thinner , out in the wind - taunted sheds behind graveyard farm .
once , when a farm boy was caught with a potato in his pocket , the reverend convinced bill childbreaker to lash him as an example , and when a clatch of girls were found swimming by moonlight at song beach - in their petticoats , not even their birthday suits ! -he had them shut in their houses for the whole rest of the summer , with signs on all their doors that said indecency is an affront to god .
the old hill - long since defeathered - was a lonesome spot , far from any farms , and its bare stone church saw visitors but rarely .
she rode and it was like gliding , down the long sodden lane from graveyard farm into town .
` ` did you ever read that book animal farm when you were growing up ? ''
as i enter , i look around in surprise , for outside , the farm seemed to me somewhat poor and rundown .
my one true opportunity came at guion 's farm , when beast asked me to tell him of his sister .
the only things i have seen on the road are small cottages and farms , but their occupants will no doubt question a maid traveling on her own and will likely already be sleeping six to a bed , with naught but a shriveled turnip from the last harvest to put in their soup pot .
the largest of the farms and manor houses nearby have been seized , and i can only hope the soldiers were merciful to those whose homes they have stolen .
instead , we are going to approach the outlying farms and homes in the hopes of protecting them from further scavenging and raids .
it is our hope that other farms have not yet been ransacked .
the first farm we pass is abandoned .
the second farm is inhabited by a more stubborn fellow ; he greets us with a pitchfork in one hand and a club of wood in the other .
while i never grow to love killing , i must admit that doing it before these men can harm others , whether by starving them or raping them or burning down their farms , feels justified , especially when there is no marque to guide me .
she usually spends her summers competing in potato - throwing contests on the farm . ''
he always sounded like he had just stepped off of a farm in kentucky .
she also looked like she should be on a farm somewhere in the midwest .
not ever , and this girl , who looked like she should be out on a farm , sure as hell should n't have been able to be the first one to do it .
i do n't know what 's going on and i do n't need some farm girl slowing me down or messing with my flow . ''
i had heard a lot of things about the way i looked , some more flattering than others , but never had anyone insinuated i looked like i belonged on a farm .
you look like a little girl on the farm .
` ` well , i ' ve never been on a farm in my life and i will do whatever it takes to keep race safe and bring him home , with or without you . ''
` ` do you think i look like a farm girl ? ''
` ` sounds like the rude type if he called you a farm girl without knowing the first thing about you . ''
he watched them like a child examining an ant farm .
chapter 2 isabella after being on the long highways for hours , i was ecstatic to pull down the dirt road to my family 's farm .
i hung up the phone and looked back at the farm .
` ` i did n't drive out to that farm to pick your ass up for you to reject me .
did you live on a farm ? ''
pulling up at our farm was always an exciting feeling .
it took me eleven and a half hours to get to north carolina , and another hour after i 'd called noah and got the address of the farm .
she 'd told me which house was hers on the farm , and i 'd seen a ton of pictures , so i knew which house to walk up to .
had she been so upset that she 'd gotten to her parent 's farm and told them the truth ?
they could n't hold me down forever and expect me to marry and raise my family on the farm without other options .
my dad was still strong from working the farm everyday , but he did n't lift weights like me .
this was n't a farm , it was a fortress .
` ` you ' ve never been on a farm before , have you ? ''
` ` when you said you lived on a farm , i had no idea it was like this .
` ` when your uncle ty was injured in that car wreck , i went to go help out in north carolina at their farm .
i ' m stuck on this f**king farm , and she 's got a fancy future ahead of her .
` ` oh , and about leaving the farm ... it will be here when you get back , whenever that may be . ''
the ranch was becoming more like a private community than a family farm .
before i knew it , we were pulling away from the farm .
in the past six months , they 'd set things on fire , broke a full - sized tractor , took a farm truck for a joyride , and shaved their cousin 's head .
both vehicles were out back as well as two gators , the gas powered atv 's that colt preferred to ride around the farm in .
by the time we 'd pulled up at the farm , i think we both felt uneasy .
he also did n't want to admit that conner and i had made his small farm a very lucrative ranch .
for the most part , i handled the chickens , conner worked with the cattle , and my dad and the other farm workers managed the produce .
if he had his choice , he 'd lock me in a tower and throw away the key , just so i could n't leave the farm .
the mitchell farm was dark as i pulled onto the dirt lane .
conner picked me in one of the farm trucks and let me know that the hospital was only a ten minute ride from the airport .
baby , you got drunk and drove to the mitchell farm .
` ` after you drank yourself into a stupor , you drove your mother 's car to the farm .
since i could n't remember going to the mitchell farm , i could n't help but wonder what happened there .
colt had to make his run around the farm , like he did every day .
when i pulled into the farm , i actually felt excited .
we spent a lot of time together on the farm , but most of the time , it was because he was helping me with something .
conner was n't built like a body builder , but from working on the farm his whole life , he had muscles in all the right places .
aside from my father , there was n't one single person that i wanted to talk to that was n't already at the farm .
in the next few days , after my cousin and his family finally left the farm , amy was insisting on reopening the salon .
i did n't want to tell him that heather had stopped by the farm .
i pulled off the farm road slowly , but heard the mud kicking up from the tires as i drove .
she seemed better once we were in my truck , headed back to the farm .
i was rock hard by the time we got close enough to start seeing the barns at the farm .
` ` you 're just saying that because i attacked you in front of your farm .
she also enjoyed seeing the horses and other livestock on the farm itself .
conner had already left to work somewhere on the farm and i really did n't see it as being a big deal .
he wo n't come onto this farm and threaten us .
they are watching the farm and the salon .
a few minutes after , we were heading back to the farm .
i remember how bad it always smelled when you pulled up to her farm .
well , unless it had something to do with me and a farm animal . ''
get all the farm hands on board .
she was too far away to do anything and ty was shorthanded on the farm since i had n't been there .
when i got back to the farm , i 'd already decided i was n't going to see her anymore .
i do n't know how many times i pulled out my phone and started to dial her number , or even considered sneaking in the medicine cabinets in the main farm house to see if there was any pain medication left over .
i did n't talk much to anyone in the family , unless it had to do with the farm .
` ` i promise you will be safe and i wo n't take you to the farm .
i watched her walk all the way to her car before pulling away and heading back to the farm .
i grabbed something to eat and went about my day working the farm .
since i was sort of like a foreman on the farm , i basically could run into town whenever i wanted as long as the work got done .
when i got back to the farm , i already had a damn text from heather .
between work on the farm and dealing with living with my family , it was easy to keep busy and not dwell on my sadness .
by the time i got back to the farm , they were waiting in their vehicle .
with what he did for a living there was always a chance he would have to head back to the farm .
we 'd talked about him working full time on the farm , but this was news to me too .
the farm is doing awesome and conner and i have more work than he can handle alone .
i 'd considered driving to the farm and begging him for another chance .
chapter 34 amy i knew as soon as i pulled off that farm lane where i wanted to be and i did n't want to wait any longer to have it .
i started my journey from my father 's to the mitchell farm around nine at night .
the fifteen minute drive from town to the farm turned out to take another hour .
there were no street lights , so when i came up to the farm , i missed the turn and slammed on my breaks .
i talked to ty and he and his dad said i can have a parcel of land on the farm and build on it .
now , for as long as my family had owned the farm , hunting was a man only hobby , but miranda had changed that .
when she and conner moved to the farm , after they lost their father , they insisted that they both go .
since he did n't go to college and had always worked on the farm , he was more southern than any of us .
it was broad daylight and we were making out in the family car , on an old farm road .
i think we circled the tree farm three times in total .
by the time we pulled up at the farm , miranda was rubbing her temples like her head was about to explode .
with ty working on the farm , he never complained about getting up at night and helping me with the boys .
ty did n't even have to ask my decision when we left that fellows farm .
conner cried his eyes out and we all hid behind some farm equipment just listening to my uncle scorning him .
much like our farm , colt had managed to close operations on the ranch for the next two weeks .
they were n't staying with us the whole time , but would enjoy the break from everyday farm life .
` ` last week i was cuttin ' mrs . emerson 's hair and i started thinkin ' about the kids , imaginin ' them runnin ' around the farm .
between the farm and his full time job , we did n't need the money .
a sudden knock at the door startled me , because everyone on the farm just walked in .
i was afraid he had seen the pictures , but he must have just seen me pulling out of the farm .
the farm was my home .
when i finally pulled into the farm , conner waved to me as i drove up to the house .
i shook my head and looked around the farm .
he would leave his parents and his farm ?
harvey could n't run all the new duties at the farm so conner and my dad left the following day .
by the time we pulled into the farm , she was ready to go to bed , unfortunately , the family had planned a welcome home surprise .
with the farm picking up cattle and the chicken houses doing well , we were really making a good living .
i knew that he and ty had their moments , but i loved him living on the farm with us .
ty had installed a little computer area in the kitchen to manage the bills and do anything else we needed to do for the farm .
` ` i 'll get coffee in the farm house , you sick bitches . ''
ty and conner were busy with new additions to the farm and the kids took up every second of my time .
with my brother and ty working so hard on the farm , i found myself consumed with mommy duty .
we had plenty of room for him on the farm itself , but he said he needed to start thinking about long term .
she was n't walking around the farm without an adult .
sure , she was basically five , but still too young to walk around a dangerous farm .
conner and i had been busting our asses so that i could give my notice and focus on running the farm .
i was really looking forward to spending my life working on the family farm and being able to spend more time with my kids .
we still had two old barns from the original farm , but they were filled with old equipment and one was all the way out by my aunt 's house .
nothing happened until she showed up at my farm . ''
she seemed so happy , and it was weird to me considering how sad she had been the months before she left to stay at ty 's farm .
yeah , ty went behind everyone 's back , but so did i. i snuck around to be with savanna on ty 's own farm .
my uncle 's farm was finally making them money and his life insurance had paid everything off .
they never had to worry about money , and ty knew the farm would one day be his and miranda 's .
they seemed happy living on the farm .
she held noah on her lap and talked all about the farm .
ever since our trip to ty 's farm , he had been obsessed with chickens .
ty and miranda were inquiring about branching out the cattle business to his family farm .
it did n't hurt that he and miranda would eventually get the farm .
` ` he ai n't coming to my farm like that colt .
` ` he ca n't come stay at the farm like this .
she knew that it would benefit not only conner , but the whole family if he moved out to their farm .
i was helping part time at the farm , but it was n't enough to start a life with .
they have a small farm and a carriage house that you and bella will be comfortable in for the time being .
when i had finally pulled out of the ranch , it was already one thirty , so with all of the stops it was nearing dark before i pulled onto the farm road .
my parents would , in due time , leave me the farm anyway , so they were n't very pushy about me moving or having to pay rent .
i had just arrived at his family 's farm .
` ` mom ran into town to do some church thing and my dad is around the farm somewhere .
since bella was sound asleep when we pulled back up at his parent 's farm , ty suggested we watch some television and relax .
` ` i took them to jeb 's farm to pet all the animals .
pulling up to the farm and seeing the lights on at the carriage house really made me feel content .
as much as her family hated it they knew she was safe staying at the farm .
izzy spotted my dad as we pulled back into the farm .
i was supposed to be living at the farm as a temporary situation .
his daddy was a farmer , like a full - fledged works the farm himself , farmer .
with him not being able to help and now having the hospital bills , they could n't afford to hire someone to work the farm while they sat at the hospital .
the hardest part of that , for me , was that tyler had bought me a horse a few years back that i happened to keep on his farm .
i am not really welcome at the farm right now and i miss her something fierce .
when i offered to come work on the farm that had been my only stipulation .
my major was business , but jobs in my small town of kentucky were hard to come by , and even though my parent 's farm had enough workers to manage itself without me , my father wanted me to be around to do the books .
` ` just helping out my uncle with the farm . ''
when we had drove without words for more than ten minutes , i let myself fall asleep and i only knew it because when i opened my eyes next i was in colt 's arms , being carried to the carriage house at the mitchell farm .
` ` you do know that i have stitched up every type of farm animal that exists ?
when i pulled back up at the farm , i noticed that my aunt and uncle were gone .
i did n't want to be in public , but the hole was at the back of the property on the farm and i knew that we would be the only two people there .
i followed suit and soon we were away from the farm and making our way through the woods .
harvey was the farm hand that lived in a trailer on the property .
because it was monday , i knew that my aunt and uncle were back on the farm , so i needed to take precautions when i took savanna to the truck to drive her back to her car .
savanna and i managed to sneak off the farm undetected .
do you want me to head back to the farm ? ''
i was staying on their farm and they would soon figure out my secret if i kept dodging from seeing them .
without having things to do at the farm , i found myself going crazy .
my family 's farm was about two miles outside of town .
when it really started to get dark , we gathered our things and made our way back to the farm .
at the woods edge , i looked in the farm house and saw my aunt and uncle sitting in the backroom in front of the television .
during the day colt would work the farm with his uncle , while i went to work , stopped by the hospital and even made my appointments with my shrink .
when the weekends came , we had free reign over the farm .
i need to get back to the farm . ''
anyway , colt saved me and took me back to the farm to rest .
i did n't follow close behind them and when they turned to drop off savanna , i kept going until i reached the farm .
i appreciate everything you have done with the farm and i ca n't say i do n't need the help .
my cousin could n't work and the farm was their only source of income .
i was thinking we could get married this fall , here at the farm when the leaves change colors . ''
after what turned out to be lunch , we headed back to the farm .
we parted ways once we got to the farm .
my uncle wanted me to stay here and help out with the farm .
i do the books for my father and a few other farms back home .
i have my own house and my own parcel of property off my parent 's farm .
colt 's chest was broad , from years of working on the farm and playing sports .
then i saw van here soakin ' wet runnin ' back to the farm later that night .
it ca n't be more then a five hours drive to that farm . ''
` ` how do i get to his parents farm ? ''
when i got to the farm , ty was standing outside waiting for me .
i think he does the finances for quite a few farms if i ' m not mistaken .
when my ex finally moved out and i got word that my uncle needed help at his farm for the summer , it seemed logical to let miranda stay here .
we can pick up all of your things and stop by the farm to get daisy .
when we got to ty 's farm , my aunt and uncle came out to greet us .
when we pulled out of the farm , i saw my uncle opening the envelope .
` ` we ' ve got a trailer on our farm .
it used to be for our farm help to live in , but he 's got his own place now .
an hour later , i 'd gotten my things from the motel and we were pulling up at the farm .
during the day , when i was n't working and the kids went to school , sarah and i did chores around the farm and got to know each other .
they married and inherited the farm from his father , who passed about a year before .
the smells of the farms are a little hard to get used to , but it is nice . ''
the old farm house that we lived in had plenty of rooms in it , especially once i was allowed to officially share a room with vessa .
i took a deep breath before i opened the old farm door to my father 's place .
aside from rescuing beautiful women who drive their cars in farm fields , i do n't get out much . ''
instead of being in public , where people could see us , we met at an old abandoned farm on the outside of her town , since she was n't willing to come anywhere near where i lived .
a little later i watched parker walking on the path toward the farm house .
grandma had been raised on a farm .
chris knew my plans to keep my roots grounded on a farm .
do you know what somethin ' like that could mean for my parent 's farm ? ''
they 're from an animal conservation farm and very well cared for .
she 's fresh off the farm .
we ' ve got one more guy to find , and then we 're busting out of this turkey farm . ''
` ` this is not a turkey farm , '' naomi says , a furrow of concern on her brow .
he does n't leave his farm much , daisy tells me , but the fact that he leaves it at all makes her happy .
well , fuck daisy , i think , but i pull on my trousers and join the surly ukrainian and his farm girl for dinner .
so if he wants to go to texas and help his parents on the farm ?
` ` are you planning on turning me into a farm girl ?
they controlled the farms , and hunting was often a fruitless effort .
i was certain callum had never built a fence or worked a cotton farm in his life .
` ` probably hard enough to justify the farm bill and corporate welfare , '' luther said .
the .357 magnum in his hand did not look like it had come off the farm .
it had picked up speed in recent decades , washing away the old pear and apple orchards and the ranchlands and dairy farms in its path .
in a few years the sleepy little town of summer river would probably be transformed into an upmarket boutique village , just as healdsburg , sebastopol , napa and the other old farm towns in the region had been changed .
` ` i noticed that most of the orchards and farms are gone . ''
the menu earnestly assured diners that almost everything , from the arugula and the cheese in the arugula - and - fried - goat - cheese salad to the handmade ravioli , was organic and had been produced within a fifty - mile radius of the establishment - in some cases by the farm that was operated by the restaurant 's owner and chef .
a few miles back , the picturesque vineyards had given way to small farms .
the lettering was so faded that it was difficult to make out the words rainshadow farm .
they met each other on the farm .
the last of the rainshadow farm residents abandoned the place a year or two after sara sent me away from summer river .
` ` sara mentioned that when the last members of the alternative community left , they donated rainshadow farm to a nature conservancy . ''
the remains of the blacktop gave way to an ancient graveled track , and then the wooden skeletons and rusted trailers that had once housed the residents of rainshadow farm came into view .
a good day to go sightseeing at an illegal pot farm . ''
` ` i wonder if the nature conservancy that bought rainshadow farm knows that someone is growing pot up there on the hillside . ''
` ` that pot farm might explain what happened to sara and mary , '' mason said .
the big illegal farms often bring in armed guards along with their own crews of migrant workers to tend the plants .
` ` so someone might have followed sara and mary from the farm and forced them off road ? ''
` ` you know , this has actually been a very nice getaway in spite of the stop at rainshadow farm .
probably freshly ground , using beans ethically sourced from an organic farm that used sustainable growing and harvesting techniques , this being summer river and all .
the last farm had been passed some time ago and sariana had seen no further sign of civilization .
it makes me feel like a farm animal . ''
mom usually has a big writers ' party the last weekend in september and meryl comes down from her farm up north to , you know , sign books and stuff .
there were fields and farms to my left , and the invisible lake unspooling on my right , and us , driving north , following the truck 's headlights on a knife edge of interstate .
before matt left , our family always made the trip up north to meryl 's farm on madeline island together .
the drive was long , over eight hours , so we 'd stay an extra day or two to kayak on lake superior , bicycle around the island , or just hang out on the farm , helping out with the sheep that meryl raised for wool .
other farms were better off , the barns painted a deep russet or a flawless , eye - watering white .
b over a third mug of coffee : mr . anderson asked about my parents , meryl , meryl 's farm , what it was like to paddle around lake superior .
they 'd even browsed real estate listings and dad made noises about how a hobby farm might be nice when he retired and mom gave up the bookstore .
i ' m also involved in an organization that makes sure land stays open in farm areas , and we try to preserve national forests and such .
humans and shifters were n't supposed to tangle , but out in farm and ranch country , in the middle of the night , rules did n't always stop anyone .
at the end of this dirt trail was an abandoned farm tucked among bushy trees , ponds and stock tanks shimmering in the moonlight .
they 'd even looked in albert 's private rooms when albert had gone off with his steward to the home farm .
the home farm would be next .
towns and farms were nonexistent , and the mountains were vast .
she does n't belong on a scottish farm . ''
he clattered into quiet villages , inquired in the local pubs , asked at farms if a gentleman had put up with them for the night .
men of all ages , shapes , and sizes had come from highforth village and the outlying farms , from sturdy lads who should have been in school all the way to a stooped elderly man who 'd come to give his decided opinions on everything .
hamish had told her he lived with his mother , sister , and uncle on a small farm , his father having died a few years ago .
there were plenty of men there from the village and those who could be spared from their farms , all happy to earn the extra wages .
he and cameron could talk about horses , but cameron raced expensive champions , while elliot had confined his horse owning to useful farm animals .
the ocean was to the east of them , the land sloping out of uplands to farms and flat land by the sea .
one day a loup bouda got into their farm .
by the time the sheriffs made it out to the farm , my grandmother had dug a hole almost six feet deep , trying to get my mother out to kill her .
it was my eleventh birthday , and the older boudas had chased me into an old farm equipment store .
their destiny turned out to be an old farm in the hills away from the sea .
the farm , however , was long gone .
the fields around them were overgrown , though farther away , on the next farm , neat plowed rows , bare with winter , lay ready for spring planting .
simon , dupuis , the rest of the men , the house , and the spread of the old farm had already receded .
the land opened out before them , a long river valley dotted with farms and small villages .
they reached dupuis ' farm by late afternoon .
the motorcar , in all its glory , sat on a long , straight , empty farm road outside paris , ready for a test run and violet 's first time driving it .
the wheels skidded on the mud of the farm road , but violet moved the tiller from side to side , naturally finding her way out of the spin .
the small farms became square patches in the rugged country of the highlands , and tree - covered hills spread before them .
farms filled the valley around the village , as did pastures full of sheep .
there were farms with hay stacked like building blocks , battered mailboxes and white fences , bird feeders and bluish grass .
it 's not just the looming threat of the ride ahead - being stuffed into seats like sardines and then catapulted through the air in a narrow metal tube - but also the terminals themselves , the press of people , the blur and spin of the place , a dancing , dizzying hum , all motion and noise , all frenzy and clamor , and the whole thing sealed off by glass windows like some kind of monstrous ant farm .
her suitcase rocks back and forth unsteadily as she hurries past the checkpoint and toward the baggage claim , deciding that the apple she grabbed from the fridge at home does n't really count as a farm product .
she had no other basis for comparison , and it seemed only logical that a city was a city , just as a farm was a farm , and a mountain was a mountain .
she had no other basis for comparison , and it seemed only logical that a city was a city , just as a farm was a farm , and a mountain was a mountain .
he 'd e - mailed her several times over the past ten days - about his holiday in ireland on his grandparents ' farm , but also about how he could n't wait to see her , how much he missed her , how he was thinking of her often - and she had n't written back once .
it might be he 's on one of the farms or rural properties outside of town , and just comes in ... for whatever it is he does . ''
` ` normally you 'd have quite a ride to the farm of the day , '' mark said into his mike as we bumped along the tarmac toward the end of the runway .
` ` we spray farms as far away as three hundred miles .
she looked pretty and young , like an english country lass in a commercial for milk or apples , except the look in her eye said she had some sharp farm implements she would like to stab him with back in the barn .
drew always parked his dad 's farm truck in the band room driveway like he owned the place .
boys in the band had already dumped the daily load of hay bales and farm implements - scythes or whatever - out onto the grass .
she explained , at a higher volume than necessary , that my presence in the farm truck bothered her .
when i relayed my schedule to barry , i would edit out the part where i invented an excuse to drive into town for a few minutes and cruise by the rent 2 own store , checking for farm trucks .
instead , he had the strong , tanned body of a farm boy used to baling hay , or swinging scythes , or whatever it was farm boys did in modern times , with his shirt off .
instead , he had the strong , tanned body of a farm boy used to baling hay , or swinging scythes , or whatever it was farm boys did in modern times , with his shirt off .
it was like we were back in the farm truck , just the two of us , with the windows rolled up and the band muffled around us .
` ` they 're telling me i have to do my work plus dad 's work on the farm .
leaning against the farm truck .
drew has to do the farm practically by himself .
i followed luther 's directions to drew 's farm .
the saddest thing was that despite everything , i wanted to sit in this sunny spot and watch drew drive up in the farm truck and climb onto the senior bus .
however , the prospect of the bloodline ending mattered not to rebeccas self - centered and business - minded grandmother , who thought the match advantageous , for someday it would merge captain vanderslices vast horse farm with her own .
if only she could keep her servant - lover from being hired away from her grandmothers farm in the process .
david stood before her , broad shoulders and slim hips appearing all the more gentlemanly tonight in her farms special - occasion finery : long jacket , tight breeches , and tall riding boots .
you own a horse farm in kentucky .
i said haughtily , i certainly do not own a horse farm .
now he was reminding me that my horse farm was his now .
he and hunter moved to our farm when hunter and i were in middle school .
you mean , they moved to your town and worked on your farm ?
no , you mean they actually moved to your farm , do nt you ?
most families would nt want to live on the farm , but they did .
and when school started in the fall , somebody figured out that his dad worked for my grandmother , and that hunter helped out at the farm , too , sometimes , and everybody started calling him wait for it stable boy , summer intoned .
when my grandmother was our age , she earned her business degree here in new york so she could run her familys horse farm .
he would major in business here , then run the horse farm .
and when she dies , he will inherit the horse farm for his loyalty .
so it does nt make sense to me that he would accept my grandmothers offer to take over the farm , i said as i pushed my way through the crowd around the puddle .
not that you would know this , he said , setting his cup back down , but running a horse farm is extremely complicated .
that probably contributed to the ass**le kids making fun of him when they found out he was living on the grounds at my farm .
i had passed by the parking lot and seen the farm truck my grandmother let him drive to school .
because he was buzzed , he could nt resist reminding me that the farm went on without me .
the last time he d handed me my music player , at my grandmothers derby party last may , he d saved me from a convo with whitfield farrell , a twenty - one - year - old college dropout who would inherit the famous farm next door .
i should not want hunter anyway because he stole my farm and he is in cahoots with my grandmother .
i huffed out a sigh and hissed , he s already got my tuition and my inheritance and a career at my farm .
the sire was from my farm .
i d never been too impressed with the father even though he d won the stephen foster handicap , but the dam was from a prestigious farm , and shed won the kentucky oaks .
in louisville we lived on your grandmothers farm and that s all there was .
how can you keep insisting you do nt belong on that farm ?
it makes no sense , that the horse farm was in the heroines blood .
in romance novels , hunter , not in real life , and then everybody unanimously agreed it was in her blood , to make her feel better about moving back to the horse farm when she did nt want to .
she felt the same as she always had , that she wanted to be a writer and she did not want to do it on a horse farm in kentucky .
if you were nt rich , you would never , ever walk away from an opportunity like running your grandmothers farm .
the man said he d heard the fillys dam had looked exactly like this filly and had been at the farm when the woman left fourteen years before .
he still works at my grandmothers horse farm , i said .
and then he stole my farm .
you have no intention of majoring in business and running my grandmothers farm after graduation .
they never would have agreed to lose your records if i told them you were my friend at twelve years old but not so much at eighteen and i had pretty much walked in and stolen the birthright to your family farm .
they led down a grassy bank to the gravel road that wound through the enormous farm .
the road disappeared over that hill , too , but he knew it pitched higher and higher with more and more hills until it reached the high point of the farm , where the bosss house perched .
he loosened a large limestone rock from the century - old wall next to his housefuck this farm , anywayand set it on the end of the tape measure to keep it secure in the middle of the road .
the sky had deepened to rose now , and he might have been worried about a car creaming him without ever seeing him in the dark , except that there was nobody out here to run him downonly the boss , and the people who worked on the farm , most of whom had gone home for the night already , or lived here like his dad in an ancient house built back when it was acceptable for workers to live on their employers land .
he had wondered about it since he d arrived here at the farm .
if a farm truck was damaged running over one , his father would kill him .
maybe i did think better of myself because my grandmother owned a kentucky horse farm .
tommy had parked the blackwell farms king - cab pickup truck at the curb .
they were both blond and had similar features , but tommys face was weathered from the sun , and he wore a blackwell farms baseball cap and windbreaker that made him look strange embracing hunter in his cashmere sweater and expensive sunglasses , obviously the heir to a horse fortune .
the blackwell farms truck crept backward along the curb , keeping pace with me .
luckily the farm was nt far , so i would nt have to sit in the truck with hunter for long .
instead , he drove the truck off the interstate , turned onto the narrow blacktop winding through the hills to the farm , then pulled onto the grassy shoulder underneath a huge , fire red maple .
i do nt know what argument hunter used outside the truck , but predictably he hopped into the drivers seat , and tommy took the passenger side for the short drive up to the farm .
you re from the same town , the same farm even , you live in the same dorm , you know all about each others business , but you have nt hooked up .
it perched on the highest hill in all of the rolling pastureland that formed the farm .
but here on the farm it drew my attention .
today i decided we would explore every corner of the farm .
i did , however , lead horses to and fro , and when a stallion reared up and kicked in protest at going back into the blackwell farms trailer , i was the one who leaped forward to grab the reins and talk him down .
groups of agents and buyers and my grandmothers assistants wandered into our farms section of the stables and out again , talking business over bourbon in clear plastic cups , lighting cigars after they d walked away from the hay .
i would hang at the periphery with other tipsy teenage heirs to horse farms , often whitfield farrell .
in the sunshine i shed my blackwell farms jacket and tied it around my waist .
our farms horse did not want to go .
she s giving him her freaking farm .
hell do right by this farm , since you do nt want to .
15 several hours later , tommy and i unloaded a couple of horses at the farm , unhitched the trailer , and drove down the hill to his house .

you love the farm .
all you have to do is convince her to major in business and run the farm .
hunter gestured to the farm truck waiting in the lane .
his family owned the neighboring farm , and her grandmother had suggested that the two of them would make an excellent couple .
she was sure her grandmother would heap praise on her for befriending the heir to the farm next door , as instructed .

he had headed over to barnegat bay bottles , the scuzziest package store in all of seaside heights , maybe new jersey , to procure a couple cases of beer and several bottles of boone 's farm wine : apple and strawberry .
a wrinkled grocery sack stuffed with twist - cap bottles of what boone 's farm called wine clattered every time jerry hit a pothole .
said jerry , who was lugging the clinking bag of boone 's farm bottles under his arm .

there were dozens of farms and what looked like small homes and cabins , each with an attached vegetable garden , clustered along one portion of a long winding lane near the forest .

` ` but i would n't bet the farm on it . ''
then there was his fear that piper would n't adjust to the farm , to going off to school , that she still did n't completely trust him .
danny had always known , at the end of the day , he was more important to willie and daniel than anything , even the farm .
there did n't seem to be a place for her in either the world she 'd been born into , or this one here on the tucker farm .
on this farm , with piper .
though a foolish voice in his head suggested that maybe amanda could be talked into staying on the farm .
then sanity returned , and he pictured an ugly breakup when amanda got tired of life down on the farm and took off for the city .

let 's head back to the farm and give the macnamaras some privacy . ''
he knew the chances that amanda would be willing to stay in cuttersville on his farm as his wife were about as big as a dust mite .

he had asked a woman who had all that money to marry him and take care of his daughter down on the farm .

a poodle was n't exactly a farm dog , but baby seemed to enjoy running around , sniffing out god only knew what .

amanda figured piper was going to be scared and nervous again for a few days , but with love and patience , they could convince her that she was safe and that she was staying on the farm with danny forever .

i 'll send aid to watch over your farm , both day and night until we locate and destroy the rogue pack and vampires .
i understand you may need a little help protecting your farm . ''
he circled the farm and the outlying area just to double - check that no more threats were close , before winging his way back to the forest .
they hit a farm just on the other side of the ridge , close to the ravine .
perhaps , if we know the pack will attack this particular farm , we should find a way to use that to our advantage , '' mikhail mused .
costin eliade yawned as he stepped outside onto his porch to look over his farm .
his farm had been in his family for two generations , and his father as well as his grandfather had done their best to improve the conditions .
he had been the first to bring cattle to the farm and successfully sell his beef to the outside world .
there was such beauty surrounding his farm and he was a man who most of the time was far too busy to notice such things , but not at dawn .
a neighbor had taken them for him , just in case his farm came under attack .
as if fen revealing that costin was merely an illusion and the warrior was waiting for them , the werewolves poured into the farm out of every conceivable cover .
clearly they 'd circled the farm and now closed in fast .
costin eliade and his cattle were safe on a neighboring farm , leaving the carpathians to build their trap for the rogues .
the moment fen saw the others going to gregori 's aid he whirled around and indicated the ground in the middle of the field where the werewolves had tried to surprise the farm .

tatijana , with the main force of carpathian warriors concentrated here on the farm , the prince , and the all - important children are left with little protection .
he stood on the edge of the swamp , taking a careful look around , seeking the best vantage point above them , where the captain directing the battle would be able to see the entire farm .
that tells me bardolf and abel have plans far beyond the destruction of costin eliade 's farm .
` ` i think abel or bardolf plans to hit the prince while the pack distracts the carpathians and lycans by hitting the farm . ''
` ` that would mean they would know about the trap at the farm and deliberately sacrificed some of their pack as a distraction . ''
` ` or they did n't know it was a trap but sent them to devastate the farm no matter what , believing warriors would come to defend it .
he was certain he would find the wolf put in charge of running the attack on the farm .
` ` there has to be something more at play here then a rogue pack overrunning a farm in retaliation for my interference .
he sent out twenty - five or thirty to the farm , figuring he might lose over half .
the battle at the farm might be ferocious , but it would n't last long .
` ` you 'll have to get to the village , tatijana , and warn the others at the farm that they 're being detained there on purpose .
they hit the farm at the same time and they targeted gregori , tatijana informed her .
at first we thought just the farm , but then when we discovered the pack had been divided into thirds , we divided our forces .

there were no farms nearby and no real landmarks should xaviero surface unexpectedly or detect her as she attempted to remove the mage - shadow .
they should have gone for the outlying farms , killing livestock and overrunning the houses to kill as many people as they could .
small farms dotted the countryside and she spotted the animals , cattle sleeping , horses moving slowly , chickens roosting .

and ... ` ` it doesna matter how many things ye do on a farm , there 's always more than ye can do .
it was nearly sunset by the time she heard the chugging of roger 's car on the farm road .
he looked around the worn , comfortable room , easily envisioning jamie at the big old desk by the window , going through the farm ledgers with his brother - in - law .
still , it was a highland village school , and most of the students came from the nearby farms and crofts .
and once they 'd got settled at lallybroch , had pestered roger into letting him drive the morris mini round the farm tracks , sitting in roger 's lap , small hands clenching the steering wheel in glee .

there were comings and goings at the house below : the slam of doors , brianna hanging out the family wash , the kids and a couple of wee lads from the next farm over who 'd come to spend the night with jem all racing through the kailyard and outbuildings , playing some kind of tag that involved a good deal of noise , their shrieks high and sharp as the cries of fishing ospreys .
once he glanced down and saw the farm and household truck , presumably come to deliver the pump for the cream separator , for roger saw brianna shepherding the driver into the barn , he unable to see around the large carton in his arms .
i stiffened a little ; there were strict prohibitions against the looting of farms , and while jamie had taken these particular hens scratching in the wild , there was no way of proving that , and this gentleman , while dressed in casual homespun and hunting shirt , bore himself with the unmistakable authority of an officer .
the people who ran the aid society had given him clothes- '' for what i had on was little more than rags '' -and helped him to find a job doing rough labor for a dairy farm outside the town .

the grating that covered the priest 's hole was hidden by a bench and several boxes of milk bottles , bits of farm equipment awaiting repair , and other items that did n't go anywhere else .
the shelves were the same , and behind his host 's head was the same row of farm ledgers that he 'd often thumbed through , conjuring up from their faded entries the phantom life of an earlier lallybroch .
she could n't stay with them at lallybroch ; the walls were two feet thick in places , yes , but it was a farm manor , not a fortified tower house , and had n't been built with any notion that the inhabitants might need to repel invaders or stand off a siege .
there was a petrol station a few miles up the road ; she stopped there to call fiona and say she 'd pick the kids up in the morning , then bought a few snacks and drove back , taking the farm track that circled the far edge of lallybroch 's land and led up into the pine plantation .
everyone froze for an instant , and the sound of an engine advancing down the farm track came clearly through the night .
` ` i ' m minded to find out , '' greene said , turning his horse 's head toward the farm .

he drove nearly ten miles , by his estimation , before concluding that there was no way the girls could possibly have outrun him , and he turned back , searching carefully along the few farm roads that led off into fields .
no more than three or four farms .
so far as roger had been able to follow ridley 's story , the strangely dressed man ( some said he was a faerie , some thought him a northerner , though there was confusion as to whether this meant a scot , a norseman , or something else ) had had the ill luck to show up at a farm two or three miles from the stones , where he had been set upon by the inhabitants , these being an antisocial clan called wad .

she knew the men pretended not to be interested in the snippets of gossip she brought to the farm twice a week , gossip being the stuff of women , but every now and then the mask of indifference slipped .
but instead she had been landed with a pregnant farm girl and a surly nurse .
neither her father nor her brothers had wanted to leave her and daniel alone while they drowned their sorrows in the pub ( they were mindful sorts , even if they did n't always come across that way ) so for several months they had brought the pub to the farm , sometimes fourteen or fifteen men hanging off the back of the pickup truck , frequently americans bearing spirits and beer , or irishmen singing songs that made murray 's eyes brim with tears , and the house was filled nightly with the sound of men singing , drinking , and occasionally daniel weeping as he tried to make sense of it all .
' i do n't think these aussie girls are too fussy , as long as they find someone to get them off the old sheep farm . '

we liberated it during the requisition of monsieur girard 's farm .
this new kommandant was gazing speculatively up at our windows , perhaps considering whether this building might provide a more suitable billet than the fourrier farm , where senior german officers slept .

they raided our wine cellars , and took the food produced by our farms .
' every night she goes to the fourrier farm .
as i made the fifteen - minute journey to the outskirts of town , to the fourrier farm where the germans had billeted themselves almost a year earlier , i lost the ability to think .
the moon disappeared behind a cloud and i stumbled down the farm track , my feet several times disappearing into ruts of icy water so that my shoes and stockings were drenched and my cold fingers tightened round the painting for fear that i would drop it .
the farm loomed ahead now , its lights blazing .
i was at the entrance to the farm .

* * * chapter twenty for the next month , i spent my recovery at jake 's farm .
instead , i did everything i usually did - rode horses on my dad 's farm and taught dance classes from morning until night .
abby was to blame as well since it had been her idea to have a pre - wedding party at the farm .
on my trembling legs that reminded me of the new colt at jake 's farm , i pushed myself forward and headed out the door into the courtyard .
my older sister andrea and i had gone up for a weeklong campout at jake 's farm .
` ` jake 's farm . ''
` ` actually , he never brought chicks to the farm .
i was thankful that when runaway train took off , jake stayed very true to his roots , which meant staying at the farm he grew up on .
the five of us had left our family farm in roswell , georgia and had descended on savannah yesterday .
but bray and melody lived about thirty minutes south of jake 's farm , preferring the country to the city .
` ` i talked with brayden and rhys , and we decided to all hang out at the farm this weekend .
sure , he said i was more and the mere fact i was going to jake 's farm meant something pretty big , but everything seemed to lead back to sex with aj .

sure wroth kicked ass as a guitarist , but he would rather be working on his farm in tennessee than on stage .
when i pulled to a stop in front of the little farm house just outside of la and i cut the engine , she frowned , glancing around us .
linking our fingers i led her toward the old farm house .
one month was going to be spent in tennessee on wroth niall 's farm .
my dad even owned stock in a few farms there ; where , i had no clue , as my mother had never let me get to know that part of my dad 's business when i was growing up .
and i definitely had nothing against farm life .
what i had against the whole thing was that it was n't going to be just wroth , liam , and marissa at the farm .
natalie had let it slip that while zander , devlin , and harris had yet to arrive , axton had already left for the farm .
apparently ax did n't visit the farm , or tennessee for that matter , unless he absolutely had to .
it looked newer than i was expecting , but i did know that once otherworld had taken off in a big way , wroth had built his mother her dream house here on the farm that had been in his family for multiple generations .
liam had told me all about the farm , and how wroth 's dad had nearly lost it to the bank .
that , along with liam 's part time job after school , had helped get the farm operating in the black .
my parents ' house was just twenty minutes from the farm .
i figured that we would be doing that for the duration of our stay at the farm .
he had promised to stop at one of the farms he had an interest in so that i would get to spend a little time with him before i left .
the plan had been for him to visit at wroth 's farm , but my dad had a few things he needed to take care so i 'd just told him i would drive over to where he was .
i glared out the window of my dad 's truck as he drove toward wroth 's farm , mad at myself for letting anything that cunt monkey had said about me get to me .
axton i did n't go back to the farm right away .
in the last four weeks he had resorted to running on the farm , and when it came to lifting weights , he 'd started lifting random animals over his head .
he 's served his country as a marine , used his enlistment bonus to pull the farm that has been in his family for five generations out of financial trouble , and treats me and his momma like we are fine china .
` ` just go back to the farm and when she decides she wants to talk to you , i 'll let you know .
the money i made from my farm was enough to let me live an above comfortable life without the need to even touch the money i made from otherworld .
marissa did n't protest as she climbed into my truck and i drove us back to the farm .
i 'd much rather be back in tennessee working on the farm , hiding away from the world .
meaning they had bigger balls than the men that worked on my farm back in tennessee .
when the farm had nearly gone under because my father had n't been able to keep up with the mortgage payments , i had joined the marines for the sign - on bonus just so i could help my parents keep a roof over marissa 's head .
she normally wore jeans and t - shirts on the farm .
i 'll send you straight back to the farm .
so you will end up at the farm where he knows you will be okay . ''
i did n't want to go near the farm .
for so long i 'd dreamed of growing old on that farm , of being wroth 's wife and raising a family there .
when i 'd still lived at the farm with him , i 'd been woken up countless times to the sounds of his nightmares .
the farm does n't even feel like home anymore . ''
if i 'd been back on the farm with the promise of rain in the air , i would open my bedroom window and wait for the rain to come before letting it lull me into a deep , peaceful sleep .
when we were at the farm , that man would go out of his way to make sure nothing hurt you .
whether it was joining the marines so that his parents would n't lose their farm and so that i could still live with them , or helping my brother pay for my medical treatments and standing by that damned window every day that i 'd been in isolation , or holding onto his control and not taking something he thought himself undeserving of .
she and axton , along with their two beautiful kids , had moved into our house on the farm and things had gone pretty smoothly for the most part .
she was used to a freaking huge house and a gigantic farm .
i will , after i finish my farm work .

maria would nt have gone through all of the trouble of risking her life to get me out of the farm , only to dump me back into the hands of the authorities for only a measly hunk of reward money .
my memory of the day she freed me from the farm was still too hazy for me to know how she had pulled off such a feat .
she looks just like what she really issomeone that escaped from a farm .
i also had no desire to go back to the farm and live out my days as a pincushioned vegetable .
i was nt planning on you being here until tomorrow afternoon , based on when i got word that the target had disappeared from the farm , the voice said , jovial and happy despite the gravity of the situation .
the memories in between then and when maria rescued me from the farm are so hazy and mottled that i really ca nt make much out of that whole mess , i said .

we were lucky that he got stuck out in that middle - of - nowhere post where they were too stupid to figure out who he really was , or he might have been on his way to the farm himself .

` ` it 's that moisture farm again , is n't it ?
owen lars was a gifted mechanic , why would he want to throw that away to live on a moisture farm ?
with so much out there just waiting to be discovered , how could owen confine himself to a measly moisture farm ?

samara pulled the hood over his head and walked briskly down the road to the entrance of the farm property .
the farm property consisted of a house ; a barn , a shed and three - grain bins that stood tall , illuminated by the light from a tall , wooden pole by the house .
the barn was across the yard and the only way to get there , other than to venture out into the farm field , was to walk exposed near the light .

with each step , the farm became more and more distant and the bridge grew larger in their sight .
the farm was a half - mile behind them by now .
noah turned away from samara and knelt on the icy road facing his farm .
you and i must return to the farm and capture the gate from the weeds .
it was quite probable that his father and samara had been taken many miles from the farm on the other side .
he had nt live on the farm for years but his dad still displayed a family portrait .
finding none , he headed to the farm truck parked alongside the grain bins .
the farm , noah replied .
that s where the farm , the gate is .

the birds flocked in the sky above the experimental farm , finding comfort and shelter in this unusual man made jungle , and their colorful noisy groups attracted the curiosity and photographic interest of neighbors and tourists alike , making it difficult for the sisters to work around the crowds that seemed to devise ever more innovative means to find their way back into the quasi - cloistered garden .
she started to bring up her brother 's wedding but apparently seth had included the wedding ceremony and regular visits to her parent 's farm in the schedule , together with additional post doctoral studies on chlorophyll metabolism in low light environments and cellular engineering for enhanced processing of carbon dioxide and rare metals .
sarah worked diligently for a couple of hours setting up cultures to the exacting specifications her demanding training accustomed her to , trying to chase away the thoughts inside her head , thoughts which after a while became a slow flowing river of memories and emotions , sunny days on the farm with her father , her brother 's wedding , the many lovely afternoons in the company of her aunts at the convent , her mother 's never assuaged concern regarding her marital status , her grandfather 's grand gestures and intense curiosity , the light shining in her hair at dawn and setting it on fire , the touch table , so familiar she could almost feel it under her fingers .

the wanderer broke back into normal space a reasonable distance from the iona orbital farm , sensor information flowed in and for the first time they saw their target .
eight long spokes radiated out from a central section , each spoke mounting numerous rectangular farm sections .
the scale of the farm was amazing , each spoke was nearly ten kilometres long .

it was nearly pitch black here , the black light bulbs the only source of illumination for the recreations of crumbling japanese farm houses with wooden grave slats in their yards .

tiny collections of dwellings often no more than three or four old farm buildings were dotted for miles around , each proudly declaring itself a village in its own right , and the police car dutifully made its way around them all most days , though in truth that was more attributable to the boredom that was the default atmosphere of the police station than any conscientious work ethic .
a scattered farm here and there , a couple of miniscule collections of centuries - old ramshackle houses that laughably labelled themselves ' villages ' and not much else .

` ` we 'll say that we ' ve finally finished with the seacoast side of hambry , and we hope to be every bit as meticulous on the farm and cowboy side .
tucked in roland 's belt was the schedule of farms and ranches - beginning with the three small spreads owned by the barony - the three of them had worked out the previous evening .
he was still gloating over the paper , with its neat list of farms and ranches and proposed dates of inspection .
when they passed the farmer , thin - faced and alone , a good man , no doubt , with a freehold farm he worked hard from first gleam to last glow and a family he loved ( but oh , there were those lamb - slaughterer eyes below the brim of his battered hat ) , she understood this leisurely course of travel , too .
remember , we 're looking for a piece of the action before she gets sent off to one of the farms .

` ` but they come from all over , '' lloyd said , and gesturing to his herdsmen added , ` ` the drovers bring a string every week , from another farm .
` ` well , '' he decided , ` ` then you all will have to help : you will go to the farms and fetch the cows and bring them along to us , and that way , '' he added , with a burst of fresh inspiration , ` ` no - one can complain to you , or sack you , because you will not have let us go off at all . ''
it helped a great deal that majestatis had suggested the notion of borrowing cows , in advance , and using the later ones to repay ; but if they were always flying about snatching cows from the nearby farms , the french were sure to hear about it : marshal lefebvre 's forces were busy snatching cows themselves .
they flew much - interrupted , stopping at any farm with a herd of moderate size , and at any towns with a clearing large enough for a courier ; but they got no news , or at least none they wanted .
tharkay said , ` ` we will find more tomorrow , '' a puzzling degree of confidence ; but the next evening he took arkady into the lead and flew directly to an estate with several handsome dairy farms , which yielded two dozen bullocks ; he watched the stupefied animals loaded onto the dragons with an odd , wry expression , which made laurence wish all the more to ask how he had known ; and equally made such an inquiry impossible .
wellesley 's spies had reported already a dozen raiding bands or more , moving through the north country , stealing from farms and seizing cattle ; laurence had marked them on his map , as best the reports could place them .
villages and farms and estates were now stripped to the bone and often torn apart in the search for hidden stores ; or even to no end but wanton destruction : some vicious urge in the soldiers , brought on by too much license to ruin what they found .
the little feral dragons of the pennines , who lived wild and ordinarily raided farms for their meals , had been recruited by hunger and temeraire 's persuasion to collect the far - flung intelligence : they darted from one beacon to another , where the townspeople provided them with a sheep or goat , and in return they carried the information back to laurence 's encampment , daily edging farther south .
an unwise outpost commander , sorely pressed , at last made the mistake for which laurence had been waiting , and sent out his dragons to hunt for themselves ; the farms immediately around their encampment had already been depleted , and the beasts separated to look farther afield .
i moved to london , and then , some years later , i moved back again , but the town i returned to was not the town i remembered : there were no fields , no farms , no little flint lanes ; and i moved away as soon as i could , to a tiny village ten miles down the road .
soon the path divided , and he took the branch that led away from the river , hoping it would lead to a house or to a farm with an empty barn .

it was a city in which the very old and the awkwardly new jostled each other , not uncomfortably , but without respect ; a city of shops and offices and restaurants and homes , of parks and churches , of ignored monuments and remarkably unpalatial palaces ; a city of hundreds of districts with strange names - crouch end , chalk farm , earl 's court , marble arch - and oddly distinct identities ; a noisy , dirty , cheerful , troubled city , which fed on tourists , needed them as it despised them , in which the average speed of transportation through the city had not increased in three hundred years , following five hundred years of fitful road - widening and unskillful compromises between the needs of traffic , whether horse - drawn , or , more recently , motorized , and the needs of pedestrians ; a city inhabited by and teeming with people of every color and manner and kind .

and then , because it was really quite late , garion fell asleep , and , perhaps because of all the familiar things in aunt pol 's kitchen down below , he dreamed of faldor 's farm , where his story had begun .
remember the night when we left faldor 's farm ?
garion , who 's far more than marginally talented , will probably remember any number of times while he was growing up on faldor 's farm when either pol or i would skillfully sidestep his questions .
at faldor 's farm when he was growing up , garion probably saw asharak the murgo about every other week , and he was prevented from telling anyone about it .
pol 's at the farm of a man named faldor about ten leagues west of there .
i put all that behind me , though , and i took the imperial highway north toward sendaria and a place called faldor 's farm .

the rivan king had grown up on a farm , and farmers habitually rise early .

the spot was perhaps six leagues northwest of the village of upper gralt , and about ten leagues northeast of where the farm of a good - hearted man named faldor is now located .
i built roads from farm to market , and to some degree i controlled prices to insure that the farmers in the duchy were not swindled by the merchants who bought their crops .
it may come as a surprise to dear old faldor that his family 's been paying me rent for the use of his farm for generations now .

i suppose i could have continued to buy food from neighboring farms , but i did n't really like to leave geran alone , and if my face became too familiar in the area , a chance word dropped in some local tavern might alert a passing murgo .

the stew we served that evening was barely adequate in my opinion , but faldor and his farm hands went at it like starving men , some of them even going so far as to pour the last dribblings of gravy over biscuits .
and that was how i cooked my way into a permanent place at faldor 's farm .
within a month , the goat , garion and i were all settled in , and i ' m sure that in the minds of faldor , durnik and the other farm workers we 'd always been there .
i was very comfortable at faldor 's farm .
' i like what i ' m doing , and i like the people here on this farm .
harvest time on a farm is the busiest part of the year for the people who grow food for a living , and my kitchen was no exception .
anyway , faldor 's farm hands had to be fed four times a day during the harvest , and that kept my helpers and me busy from well before dawn until several hours past sunset .
i think everybody on the farm was very happy to see the last wagonload of turnips come in out of the fields .
the farm hands went absolutely wild over that one .

we were on the road to kurik 's farm .

faldor 's farm , garion .
faldor 's farm . '
once again garion felt the tense excitement as he held back slightly , reaching back into his memories of faldor 's farm to steady himself .
they covered in some detail the various adventures they had shared since that wind - tossed night so long ago when garion , belgarath , aunt pol and durnik had crept out through the gate of faldor 's farm into the world where the possible and the impossible inexorably merged .

the compound was quite nearly as large as faldor 's farm , half a world away .
` ` it 's the most practical design for a farm , durnik , '' belgarath told him , ` ` and sooner or later , practical people the world over are going to arrive at it .
` ` we ' ve had people chasing us ever since the night we left faldor 's farm .
always before , the word ` ` homesick '' had been associated with faldor 's farm -the kitchen , the broad central courtyard , durnik 's smithy , and all the other dear , treasured memories .
a kingdom is very much like a farm , really .
` ` probably because you were n't raised on a farm , '' garion replied .
` ` it could n't have been yesterday , because yesterday i took that load of barrels over to toad - face 's farm .
when belgarath learned of this , he went up to the quiet farm in sendaria where polgara was rearing a boy named garion , who was the last descendant of the rivan line .
to fall back into the pattern of immediately obeying her peremptory commands relieved him of the necessity of making difficult decisions and took him back to those days when he was just a simple farm boy with none of the cares and responsibilities that had come to him with the crown of riva .
he had grown up on a farm not really all that much different from this one , and the thought of a band of marauding soldiers swooping down on faldor 's farm , burning and killing , filled him with a vast outrage .

justice , he had been told , was an abstraction , but he was determined that , should the mallorean deserters responsible for the atrocity at the farm ever cross his path , he would turn the abstract into an immediate reality .
back at faldor 's farm it was nearly summer now .
polgara the sorceress had been living with a young boy , who called her aunt pol , in obscurity on a farm in sendaria .
polgara insisted that the boy must accompany them on the quest , so garion accompanied his aunt pol and belgarath , whom he knew as a storyteller who sometimes visited the farm and whom he called grandfather .
durnik , the farm smith , insisted on going with them .
soon , in keeping with the accords signed after the battle of vo mimbre , the boy who had come from a humble farm in sendaria to become the rivan king was betrothed to the princess ce'nedra .
` ` i seem to remember that from faldor 's farm .
he had grown up on a farm in sendaria , and his childhood had been that of an ordinary farm boy.when he had first come to the basalt throne in the hall of the rivan king , he had known much more about farm kitchens and stables than he had about throne rooms and council chambers .

` ` i was raised on a farm in sendaria , my lady , '' he reminded her .
he and ce'nedra were leaping from the loft in the barn at faldor 's farm into the soft hay piled below .
those two passages , however , proved to be the only ones in the entire volume that did not speak of the day - to - day business of that forgotten farm somewhere in arendia .
though he had not known it , this burden of responsibility had descended upon him on that windy autumn night so many years ago when he , aunt pol , belgarath , and durnik had crept through the gate at faldor 's farm and out into the wide world that lay before them .

they buried kurik beneath a tall elm tree on a hill overlooking his farm about noon the following day .
sparhawk was not as good as his squire had been at judging the weather , but the sudden appearance of a patch of blue sky and bright sunlight hovering just over the farm and touching no other part of the city of demos made him more than a little suspicious .
` ` how far is his farm from here ? ''
they passed briefly through farm country , and neat farmsteads stood here and there along the road .
when we get to my farm in demos , i 'll give you some more instruction . '
the farm showed kurik 's careful attention to detail .
as he wandered through the nearby farms , he began to have some second thoughts about his decision to tell dahlaine that he wanted no part of any war here in the land of dhrall .
` ` well , the farms , i suppose , but there are many farms in holy aracia 's domain .

his father 's farm covered many acres of land spread out over the gently rolling hills , and every crop had its proper place - wheat to the west and south , vegetables to the north , and the orchard close in just to the east of the well - shaded house .
` ` mining towns are n't like farm villages , '' silk pointed out .
sendaria was a land of farms , and her storehouses bulged .
he was at faldor 's farm when we visited there last winter . ''
it was rundorig , garion 's boyhood friend from faldor 's farm , and he was openly weeping .
he was at faldor 's farm again .
as if suddenly awakened by that single stimulus , a flood of memories of other smells crashed in on garion 's consciousness - the warm smell of freshbaked bread in aunt pol 's kitchen back at faldor 's farm , the salt smell of the sea when they had reached darine on the north coast of sendaria on the first leg of their quest for the orb , the stink of the swamps and jungles of nyissa , the stomach - turning smell of the burning bodies of the sacrificed slaves in the temple of torak which even now shattered and fell in upon itself among the collapsing walls of rak cthol .
he seemed to hear the ring of durnik 's hammer on the anvil at faldor 's farm , and then the plodding step of the horses and the creak of the wagons in which they had carried turnips to darine back when this had all begun .
the search that had so abruptly interrupted his quiet life at faldor 's farm was over , but it had changed him in so many ways that the boy who had crept out through the gate at faldor 's farm in the middle of a windswept autumn night no longer even existed .
the search that had so abruptly interrupted his quiet life at faldor 's farm was over , but it had changed him in so many ways that the boy who had crept out through the gate at faldor 's farm in the middle of a windswept autumn night no longer even existed .
the thought of grolims marching up to the gates of faldor 's farm outraged him .
` ` to faldor 's farm . ''
it was perhaps noon of the following day when they turned off the main road leading to erat into the country lane that led to faldor 's farm .
` ` i think his mother remarried - anyway , they 're on a farm down on the other side of winold .
the gate of the farm stood open , and good , honest faldor , beaming and rubbing his hands with delight , was bustling around aunt pol , durnik , and ce'nedra .
` ` will you show me the farm , garion ? ''
` ` if you 'd stayed here at the farm , though , you 'd have married her , would n't you ? ''
` ` probably , '' he admitted , ` ` but i did n't stay at the farm . ''
aunt pol said as they rode across the hill that put faldor 's farm irrevocably behind them .
` ` i guess i always thought that when this was all finished , maybe we could go back to the farm - but we wo n't , will we ? ''
the visit to faldor 's farm had forever closed that door to him , even if it had ever really been open .
whatever else he is or might become , he 's still the plain , simple boy he was at faldor 's farm .
it was broader than the gate at faldor 's farm , and the upper edge of it was lost in the swirling sleet .
` ` do n't you sometimes wish that i was just garion again , and you were the old storyteller coming to visit faldor 's farm - with aunt pol making supper in the kitchen as she did in the old days - and we were hiding under a haystack with a bottle i 'd stolen for you ? ''
she felt awkward , even gauche , like some ignorant farm girl .
it seemed to flutter against his mind , feeling almost like the wriggling touch of the tadpoles he had once caught in the pond at faldor 's farm .
faldor 's farm with its green , sun - drenched fields was so far behind him that it seemed lost in a kind of receding haze , and he was desperately homesick .
in the simple world of faldor 's farm she had been mistress pol , the cook , but in the world beyond faldor 's gate she was polgara the sorceress , who had watched the passage of four millennia with a purpose beyond mortal comprehension .
garion was not a fencer , but his reflexes were good and the chores he had performed at faldor 's farm had hardened his muscles .
` ` at faldor 's farm .
brill had not changed much since they 'd left faldor 's farm .
an inadvertant remark about faldor 's farm had revealed quite early to the princess his former status as a scullery - boy , and she used the knowledge heartlessly to browbeat him into a hundred stupid little errands every day .
so he told her about faldor 's farm , about the kitchen and durnik 's smithy and doroon and rundorig and zubrette .
` ` i thought i was , but so much has happened since we left the farm that sometimes i ca n't even remember what she looks like .
we used to live on faldor 's farm , but mister wolf came and we- '' ` ` do people call her something besides aunt pol ? ''
i did n't used to believe it , but i guess it has to be true because one time he- '' ` ` and why did you all leave faldor 's farm ? ''
part one - sendaria chapter one the first thing the boy garion remebered was the kitchen at faldor 's farm .
no matter how high garion rose in life , he never forgot that all his memories began in that kitchen.the kitchen at faldor 's farm was a large , low - beamed room filled with ovens and kettles and great spits that turned slowly in cavernlike arched fireplaces .
for one thing , she was taller than the other women on faldor 's farm - very nearly as tall as a man - and her face was always serious - even sternexcept with him , of course .
faldor 's farm lay very nearly in the center of sendaria , a misty kingdom bordered on the west by the sea of the winds and on the east by the gulf of cherek .
the people of his farm , knowing this , filed with some decorum into the dining hall before each meal and sat in the semblance at least of piety before attacking the heaping platters and bowls of food that aunt pol and her helpers had placed before them .
because of faldor 's good heart - and the magic of aunt pol 's deft fingers - the farm was known throughout the district as the finest place to live and work for twenty leagues in any direction .
less fortunate men who worked at other farms were frequently seen , after several pots of ale , to weep openly at descriptions of one of aunt pol 's roasted geese , and the fame of faldor 's farm spread wide throughout the district .

the most important man on the farm , aside from faldor , was durnik the smith .
there were other children on faldor 's farm , as was only natural in a community of sixty or so .
the older ones on the farm all worked , but there were three other children of about garion 's age on the freeholding .
or , after durnik the smith had proclaimed the ice safe , they would slide endlessly across the frozen pond that lay glittering frostily in a little dale just to the east of the farm buildings along the road to upper gralt .
as it happened , during that particular summer the men on faldor 's farm were talking about the battle of vo mimbre , the most cataclysmic event in the history of the west .
although twenty generations had passed since that titanic encounter , it was still as fresh in the memory of the sendarian farmers who worked on faldor 's farm as if it had happened only yesterday .
later , in the kitchen , where all injuries on the farm were routinely taken , aunt pol tended their wounds with only minimal comments about them .
chapter two not long after in the endless noon of garion 's boyhood , the storyteller appeared once again at the gate of faldor 's farm .
his eyes were a deep and merry blue , forever young and forever full of mischief.the storyteller appeared from time to time at faldor 's farm and was always welcome .
she called him ` ` old wolf , '' and his appearance at the gate of faldor 's farm marked the resumption of a contest which had obviously been going on for years .
` ` well , '' he said , somehow not quite so sure of himself , ` ` the oldest man i ever heard of is old weldrik over on mildrin 's farm .
the villagers , of course , were all too important to pay any attention to an old man and a small boy in a farm cart .
the world of the villagers was obviously very different from the world of faldor 's farm .
` ` faldor reads , i think , but no one else at the farm knows how . ''
it 's a long way back to faldor 's farm . ''
rundorig sprouted like a young tree and was soon almost as big as any man on the farm .
the festival of erastide took place in midwinter , and , because there was little to do on a farm like faldor 's at that season , it had by custom become a splendid two - week celebration with feasts and gifts and decorations in the dining hall and little pageants honoring the gods .
faldor , though he was a good , simple man , had no illusions about how widely his sentiments were shared by others on the farm .
he thought , however , that some outward show of devotional activity was in keeping with the season ; and , because he was such a good master , the people on his farm chose to humor him .
their arrival , however , marked the beginning of the erastide festival at faldor 's farm ; so , while no one cared for them personally , their appearance was always greeted with a certain enthusiasm .
` ` this is faldor 's farm , and on faldor 's farm we do no work and conduct no business on erastide . ''
` ` this is faldor 's farm , and on faldor 's farm we do no work and conduct no business on erastide . ''
` ` quite probably your friend met a pair from another farm . ''
a few days later anhelda and eilbrig packed up and left on their return journey to the city of sendar , and faldor 's farm returned to normal .
garion found brill to be a definitely unattractive addition to the farm .
chapter five in midautumn that year , when the leaves had turned and the wind had showered them down from the trees like red and gold snow , when evenings were chill and the smoke from the chimneys at faldor 's farm rose straight and blue toward the first cold stars in a purpling sky , wolf returned .
` ` you 're a good man , faldor , and your farm has been a haven to me when i needed one .
although garion was much too excited to eat , supper that evening seemed as ordinary as any meal on faldor 's farm had ever been .
when supper was over , as was always the case when he visited the farm , mister wolf was prevailed upon to tell a story .
` ` how long has this man brill been at the farm ? ''
faldor 's farm had been the only home he had ever known .
faldor 's farm was only a pale , dim blur in the valley behind .
harvests are moving from field to farm , from farm to village and from village to town .

` ` sometimes i wish we were all back at faldor 's farm . ''
` ` what i mean is , they all treat her as if she were a noblewoman or something , and she acts differently too , now that we 're away from faldor 's farm . ''
` ` will you be going back to faldor 's farm when this is all over ? ''
` ` he buys farm goods all over sendaria and has them held on the farms until the markets are right in arendia and tolnedra .

` ` i have some hams on a farm near medalia , '' he announced .
it was not that he was in the habit of being deliberately deceptive , but it had occurred to him in the last day or so that he had not had a single moment alone since they had left faldor 's farm .
it occurred to him as he waited that he had changed a great deal since they 'd left faldor 's farm .
late in the afternoon when the sun had begun to drop into a purple bank of clouds toward the west , they arrived at the farm where they were to pick up mingan 's hams .
the farm was not faldor 's , but it was familiar enough , and there was that comforting sense of having walls about him again that made him feel secure .
well , everybody in sendaria who thought he was important journeyed to fundor 's farm and found him vigorously fertilizing his fields , and they greeted him with a great cry , ` hail , fundor the magnificent , king of sendaria , ' and fell on their knees in his august presence . ''
the familiar practical sensibility with which she had ruled her kitchen at faldor 's farm had somehow been replaced by a kind of demanding willfulness that garion found particularly distressing .
desperately he wanted to go home , back to faldor 's farm , where he could sink himself in unthinking obscurity in a quiet place where there were no sorcerers or strange searches or anything that would even remind him of aunt pol and the cruel hoax she had made of his life .
unlike aunt pol 's well - ordered kitchen at faldor 's farm , everything here was chaos and confusion .
sometimes i wish we 'd never left faldor 's farm . ''
one of them came to faldor 's farm once and told durnik that he was going to die twice .
he used to come to faldor 's farm and watch me when i was little . ''
i know da english for farm animals because my granfadder had a farm and he hadt lots of american friends . ''

we do n't really have the swamp anymore , so we ca n't risk leaving the ranches and farms understaffed . ''
stone bridges spanned swift , narrow rivers , while small farms spread in rings around holdfasts walled in wood and stone .
` ` it 's all just fields and farms and holdfasts . ''
they crossed the rolling hills of norvos , past terraced farms and small villages where the townsfolk watched anxiously from atop white stucco walls .
we hunt and farm , tend the horses , milk the cows , gather firewood , cook the meals .
as the first men carved out holdfasts and farms , they cut down the faces and gave them to the fire .
yet she knew that beyond them was open country , farms and fields and forests , and beyond that , north and north and north again , stood winterfell .
some drove farm wagons or bumped along in the back of ox carts .
then the sound came drifting across farm and field and rolling plain , indistinct as the murmur of some distant sea , but swelling as they rode closer .
they rode north , away from the lake , following a rutted farm road across the torn fields and into the woods and streams .
half the time he slept in the saddle now , trusting his stallion to follow whatever rutted farm track or game trail they were on .
from time to time columns of horsemen passed down the winding farm roads , the twin towers of frey flying before them .
she stayed close to the water , passing fields and farms , and a little after midday a town appeared before her .
` ` some farm boy on a piebald horse went by , and an hour later half a dozen men afoot with staves and scythes .
the farm folk gave her curious glances , but no one spoke to her .
most of the queue waiting to enter duskendale were farm folk with loads of fruits and vegetables to sell .
she left the town by the north gate , riding slowly through the fields and farms where the worst of the fighting had been , when the wolves came down on duskendale .
the farm folk watched them warily as they came trotting up , but once brienne made it plain that she meant them no harm , they let her ride beside them .
the knight waved the farm folk through the gate .
there are orchards , farms , mines ...
perhaps your dancers would sooner build or bake or farm .
as jaime lannister and his escort wound through the rolling hills into the vale , little remained of the fields and farms and orchards that had once surrounded raventree - only mud and ashes , and here and there the blackened shells of homes and mills .
every city and every farm .
or a ... a poor farm boy , even ? ''
he never liked crowds , preferring the solitude of the woods and the fields of the family farm , an inclination that would serve him well when the time of cleansing arrived .
all marie - josephe 's dowry , and most of haleed 's gift of pearls , had gone to fitting out the ship and buying a small stud farm , where jacques now had charge of zachi and zelis and the other arabians , and hercules the cat had charge of the mice in the stable .
he thinks he can remember stories about them breaking free from boar farms and going feral , but he 'd never thought they were actually real .
it runs down thru a series of gulches at the east of town , starting way up to the north past our farm and coming down the side of the town till it flattens out into a marshy part that eventually becomes the swamp .
he tried to teach me reading and writing , too , but mayor prentiss caught wind of it in my noise one morning and locked ben up for a week and that was the end of my book - learning and what with all that other stuff to learn and all the working on the farm that still has to be done every day and all the just plain surviving , i never ended up reading too good .
all the houses and such are out and about , outskirts like , farms , meant to be farms , some still are , some stand empty , some stand worse than empty .

they off themselves like mr royal or some of them just plain disappear , like mr gault , our old neighbour who used to do the other sheep farm , or mr michael , our second best carpenter , or mr van wijk , who vanished the same day his son became a man .
he sighs his cillian sigh and here we go : ` ` it 's not like we ask you to do so much around here , todd '' - which is a lie - ` ` but we ca n't keep this farm running by ourselves '' - which is true - ` ` and even if you ever finish all yer chores , which you do n't '' - another lie , they work me like a slave - ` ` we 'd still be playing a catch - up to nothing , now would n't we ? ''
blast him , blast him and all , i think , in more or less those words and worse as i stomp across our farm .
we live about a kilometre north - east of town and we do sheep on one half of the farm and wheat on the other .
i ' ve been listening out for ben 's noise over the farm and i ' ve tracked him down to one corner of one of the wheat fields .
ma convinced pa and ben convinced cillian and when the ships landed and the settlement started , it was my ma and pa who raised sheep on the next farm over from ben and cillian growing wheat and it was all friendly and nice and the sun never set and men and women sang songs together and lived and loved and never got sick and never never died .
and it can only be coming from our farm .
there 's another bang from the farm .
he shouts and takes off , looking back once as he runs and then racing off back to the farm , back to whatever 's happening at the end of the world .
we ' ve gotten outta hearing distance from the farm and the river veers away east a little before it enters the top of the swamp so it 's taking us away from the town , too , and after a minute there ai n't nothing following us as we run ' cept my noise and manchee 's noise and the sound of the running river which is just loud enough to cover the noise of a hunting croc .
` ` yer sposed to be at yer farm right now , boy . ''
he tried to kill me , he wanted to kill the girl , he 's responsible for the ruckus in town , he 's got ta be the one who sent the mayor to the farm and cuz of that he 's responsible for ben and cillian .
my throat still hurts , my face still hurts , my chest still hurts , my noise keeps pounding me with visions of bad news , of how good a fight ben and cillian managed to put up at the farm , of how long it 'll take mr prentiss jr to find out where i ' ve gone , of how long it 'll take him to be on his way after me , after us ( not long at all , if he ai n't already ) , so who ruddy cares if she knows how to use a torch .
i open up to the map again and i follow ben 's arrows from our farm down the river and thru the swamp and then outta the swamp as it turns back into river .
i point to our farm north of prentisstown on the map .
but then i realize that means whatever happened at the farm is definitely over with .
i ' m telling her what every boy in prentisstown knows , the history even the dumbest farm boy like yours truly knows by heart .
heard the boom all the way back at the farm , oh , yeah . ''
` ` ben said- '' ` ` ye two pups come to my farm , get some good eatings in ye , sleep on a bed - tho it ai n't soft , i grant ye that - and in the morning , we 'll go to the settlement . ''
we all come outta the rocky bit of the path and round a low rise and suddenly there 's a farm ahead of us , rolling up and down little hills but you can see fields of wheat , fields of cabbage , a field of grass with a few sheep on it .
cuz i ' m on a path and it 's the swamp but it 's also the town and it 's also my farm and ben 's there and cillian 's there and viola 's there and they 're all saying , ` ` what 're you doing here , todd ? ''
` ` i ' ve got to get back to my farm , pups , '' hildy says .
yer a farm boy , ai n't ye ? ''
` ` all kinds of work to be done on a farm , '' francia says , ` ` as i ' m sure ye know all too well- '' chattering away like this , francia gets me out the back door .
` ` i know how farms work , mim , and i- '' ` ` i ' m sure ye do but ye may have noticed that prentisstown ai n't our most popular neighbour .
` ` they would have reached her farm first .
i ' m looking right into his eyes which are awake and alive and about to win , his noise the same , pictures of him in farbranch , pictures from back at my farm , pictures of me kneeling in front of him .
if i coulda killed mr prentiss jr back at the farm , he would n't ' ve led the mayor 's men to ben and cillian and would n't ' ve lived to harm manchee so .
` ` i ' m built for farm labour .
or i did n't , anyway , and we had put the farm together and i thought it would blow over before anything really bad happened .
i remember his noise from back on the farm , about my birthday , about how a boy becomes a man .
since yer pa passed , our close friends ben and cillian have been helping me out since theirs is the next farm over .
cuz the thing ben showed me back when i left our farm , the way that a boy in prentisstown becomes a man , the reason that boys who ' ve become men do n't talk to boys who are still boys , the reason that boys who ' ve become men are complicit in the crimes of prentisstown is- it's- and i make myself say it- it 's by killing another man .
cuz the ewes i had back on the farm had noise , too , and if women ai n't got noise- ` ` because women are not animals , '' the mayor says , reading me .
farm fields start showing up red and green thru the trees and up the hills , with crops i reckernize and others i do n't .
but it 's farm work .
he 's just running and staring back and the rows of spackle are all looking back at me , too , their stupid silent faces with less expresshun than the dumbest sheep i ever had back on the farm and my hand is bleeding and my ears are ringing and my face is stinging from the scratches and i saved his stupid life and this is the thanks i get ?
across the road here , this far from town , there are mostly farms and farmhouses , working their way up sloping hillsides , back towards more forest .
1150 pairs of spackle eyes are watching us , watching me , like they 're just effing farm animals looking up from their grazing cuz they heard a loud noise .
the first bomb since the prison break went off last night , taking out a well and pump on a farm .
` ` that 's not what happened- '' i think about the two men who raised me , who loved me , and how cillian died on our farm to buy me time to escape and how davy shot ben on the roadside for doing exactly the same thing .
hardly any of this group wanted to be soldiers but were forced into it by the mayor , forced from families , from farms and shops and schools .
and i can see him thinking , thinking about his farm , thinking about the horses he and his pa used to have , three of 'em , all tan - coloured with white noses , thinking about how they were taken by the army but how he ai n't seen 'em since , which probably means they died in battle- a thought which makes angharrad say boy colt ?
i can see the squiggles of mr tate and mr o'hare 's handwriting skittering in blips and blobs across the page like the black micro - rats we used to get in the barn back at the farm , twisting and turning so fast when you lifted up a board it was hard to see a single one of 'em .
i point up the road , to a little farm off to the right , up a hill with a forest above it where the fire has n't reached .
i am at the front of the guard now , the source still with me , ahead of the first of our soldiers , their fires lit and ready to be shot , and behind them- behind them the entire voice of the land- quickening its stride- nearly there , i show to the source , as we pass through a deserted clearing farm swamped by receding waters and on up through a dense forest- we march through it , faster , faster still- the voices of the clearing hear us coming now , hear our voice , hear our innumerable voice bearing down on them , hear the battlehorn blown again- and we march onto a small flat of land and up through another rise- and i burst through a wall of foliage , acid rifle raised- and i am the sky- i am the sky- leading the land into its greatest battle with the clearing- the fog is thick and i seek out the clearing in the whiteness , preparing my weapon for its first firing and ordering the soldiers to raise their burning bolts and ready them to fire- to purge the clearing from the world once and for all- and then a single man from the clearing emerges .

they all return to the thelee farm , breakfast and share stories of fun times with taffy and mccamy like many surviving family member do after losing their loved ones .
throngs of friends , neighbors , and farmers invade thelee farm with food , words , and touches of sadden , and sorrow after director hicos presentation of sixteen - years old apprentices from the colony of south beach .
zapata accepts her hand , then twirls tulu gracefully around in a gentle circle , settling her next to his elbow on the left side , and cuddles her hand , arm , and shoulder into his hard steel - like muscled naked chest while smiling goofy with the thin line of red lips similar to a farm chicken .
the masks that represent the planet earth animals of cat , dog , horse , cow , lamb , chick , and other mellow farm animals that are long dead from the third nuke wars bob their skulls in silence acceptance .
chick / taffy gallops to the south beach girls who represent the farm animals of swan , goldfish , and raccoon , all un - masked , crying in panic , fear , and fright .
he s named after the cliffs near the fresh - water bay of his daddys farm where baycliff shoved them to their deaths then escaped .
tick swiftly shuffles taffys hands , gathering her wrists behind her back muscles as taffy defensively kicks a bare foot heel like an old farm mule at his kneecap then tick sways his body to the left , tumbling his body towards the floor .
he s ourhes our old friend from south beach , and school , and the farm ?
taffy is used to live insects and rodents living with her on her daddys farm in their own nest , not wanting to hold it for fun and games as atoka comments and giggles .
andwe get back homeon my farm .
the banana spiders or giant wood spiders are from the nephila genus of spiders and are the oldest surviving species with discovered fossilized cavemen - like specimen known from 165 million years ago that s what the history book read in farm school as taffy recalls .
she fondly thinks of yesterdays in south beach before the honeysuckle ball at her daddys farm when baycliff would bring her a handful of wild pink roses ( without cow drool ) .that he had collected around the cow pastures during his visual inspections of the baby calves and loose fence posts .
then , rusk visited taffy during their evening mealtime after farm chores at the thelee farm , tagging slowly behind mccamy who lovingly tongue drools over his girl tulu while rusk presented taffy with a hand bouquet of sweet red flowered honeysuckles ( without the poisonous berries ) .like his twin .

wolf sounds like a farm pig then chuckles while he attacks and hugs on atoka as she snarls violently between his naked biceps .
folks wo nt have them around their farms .
i live and work on my farm .
best friends for life who study hard on academics inside the schoolhouse , work hard on chores outside the farm fields , and play hard for fun around the rock cliffs while growing up from toddlers to teens along with rough and tough cowboys of mccamy , rusk , hixson , and baycliff .
my childhood friends and farm neighbors are within months of the solar suns and lunar moons as i being born in the same calendar year making us seventeen - years old on planet earth .
however , amita is happy , and desires to participate , and leave south beach for a soft city slicker job instead of a hard farm hand while she demands baycliff to leave with her .
pocola , mccamy and rusks mama loves the outdoors , and rights beside her husband on the farm tractor plow , inside the hay barn , and toils the reddish sandy soil for growing crops of corn , cotton , and soybeans like a country princess .
rusk slowly cheers back into health his normal personality and shyly flirts with me while we faithfully attend school and vigorously attune our days to our separate farm chores .
mccamy engulfs tulu with his sadness , his happiness , and his love , talking minutely about their marriage while he slowly takes over ebros farm and farm duties for the upcoming retirement of ebros hard working farm life .
mccamy engulfs tulu with his sadness , his happiness , and his love , talking minutely about their marriage while he slowly takes over ebros farm and farm duties for the upcoming retirement of ebros hard working farm life .
mccamy engulfs tulu with his sadness , his happiness , and his love , talking minutely about their marriage while he slowly takes over ebros farm and farm duties for the upcoming retirement of ebros hard working farm life .
we start our own investigation by talking with friends and neighbors of the former apprentices , finding that new folks have been deeded to old farms from metro city birmingham in the name of director hico , or superintendent vovina who do nt either person live currently inside the boundary limits of south beach .
we spy on the closest sold farms during day while skipping school without mama and daddys permission and tattle - tail tulus knowledge while baycliff and i see folks , not farmers , drilling with strange beeping manual instruments into the plowed fields , water streams , and cotton fields looking for something .
we sneak under window panes and listen to spoken english words : steal , farms , hurt , farmers , bite - nats .
so , i plot the majestic death scene at the fiery fusion on ebros farm near the birmingham cliffs .
mccamy , rusk , baycliff , hixson and i are the bestest climbers in the south beach colony since our farms lay upon the peak tops of numerous flat table limestone cliffs made of both beauty and danger .
ebros farm .
then , wethree struggle upright in our protective fire gear , and climb on fours ( gloves and boots ) inside the home - made holes while tulu bravely fights heat and tears searching for our bodies , unsuccessfully when rusk arrives and finds nothing , literally and return with tulu back home to thelee farms .
while mccamy and i climb out our secure and safe hidey holes , shimmy up the limestone cliff rocks then limp to baycliffs farm hiding after lunch then head out for metro city birmingham , planting our dead buries figuratively under the basement cellar inside metro city hall right underneath hicos bee_hind as hixson and rusk follow us later the next day .
director hico personally visits thelee farms , gently persuading tulu to accept an empty seat in the apprenticeship program along with the other sixteen - year old students since has been one of her life long dreams as well as mamas dream for the good obedient daughter then tulu shows up as apprentice while mccamy , rusk , hixson , and baycliff pose as dancers , being assigned as the apprentices escorts to protect and watch over tulu .
we get back homeat my farm .
[ : ) fowler farms , north section .
fowler farms paints a portrait of smooth brown valleys of soybeans that sway besides long fields of bright yellow waist - high hay with miles of open green grasslands dotting with tiny spots of colored white and black dairy and beef cows used for food and leathers as well as an array of blending tints of yellow and white , solid black , bay and black , and chestnut skins that represent the different types of breeding horses , including colts and fillies .
the breeds include paint , quarter , and morgan since fowler farms is primarily a horse ranch providing the only four - legged mammals for work , transportation , and pleasure to the good citizens of south beach .
fowler farms will never let strays go hunger .
rochelle swiftly stands from the chair and finger points while shuffling her body towards the front porch doorway which leads to different areas of the farm , the pond , the barn , the pastures , and the playground .
i saw you watching the dance competition on tv when we were penned like a farm hogs inside hicos pretend prison looking real sad about the other teens that died the other night .
we work good like a farm team of draft horses.me , you , taffy , baycliff , rusk , hixson.even that good old boy , wolf - man .
i just wanted to see something new and different besides that farm , farming , and farm animals .

then , weme and the farm hands would drive the tractor into the fields plowin or plantin or harvestin something .
there s always something to do on a cow and corn farm .
the one and only taffy from thelee farms , she found me , not you .
he grins with a wickedly smile as she smile and nods with positive response then he adds , scanning the open terrain of fowler farms .
different but sorta like my farm .
you told me all about your farm located on the limestone cliffs with the van ride down , remember ?
i guess all farms here in south beach have about the same landscapes of yellow corn stalks , white cotton fields , and lots of black and white cowsover theregrazing quiet and mellow .
before last night , i have never killed a person , maybe lots of animals including sick livestock on the farm and hunting wildlife around the woodlands .
my farm do nt have fun thingsonly cotton , cows , and cornmaybe some cats , and bears .
taffy swirls her body into the iron chair off the back porch near the flower and vegetable garden , rotating her neck muscles around the lovely landscaped grounds of fowler farms .
so , if you drive due south , you stop at the limestone powdered cliffs of birmingham right before ebro farm and after thelee farm that border the seams and reams of the infamous limestone rock cliffs .

daddy was one of them dna genetic engineers before the nuke war and told me as a tike when we horsed around the farm with the bite - nats , painting on our bodies for fun .
i learned from fowlers tv in the living room that hico has renovated that old hotel near baycliffs farm on the outskirts of the limestone cliffs .
pemona clears each room , closing each door for safety as almena treats fowlers arm before their escape from their home since fowler farms is un - safe until director hico has been run out of south beach .
ebro farms .
the purpose of rain is to clear the dry humid air , water the sprouting farm crops and replenish the drinking fresh ponds as amita stills her five feet and nine inched tall body with her plastered brown hair clinging to her collar bone and back muscles with a partial dry and wet worn yellow cozy wool blanket trailing down to the wet planks then lounging at the top of the first puddle of water decorating the rock steps , during the rain storm as she suspiciously observes with her narrowed eyelashes the interior dark room with these darker panels made from the surrounding maple trees along ebros woodlands inside the tiny shack on edge of the birmingham cliffs .
rusk orders nasty with a baritone trombone to his twin , mccamy as the boys of six feet , four inches of blonde cropped hair with hardy farm work suntanned bulging biceps carry numerous heavy and wet boxes of gear from the skeleton atv vehicles without any protective covered or clothed roof tops during the unstoppable waterfall from heaven inside the tiny shelter .
i saw it beforenot at daddys farm but another rancher .

we started talkingat fowler farms some random funny things .
she told me about her childhood on the farm , her friends , her playground ( holds up hands ) .
ya do nt own a farm , rusk ?
fowler farms , fowler do nt have sons .
mccamy screams , slapping the bed of the truck for gathering their ammo for the fight with the riders and the rescue of their families at the barn on thelee farms .
thelee farms .
taffy enjoys the moment , remembering their fun times before amita was found inside that dank dark silo and pulled back into the bright yellow earth , playing with baycliff like they did before breakfast , school , and in - between chores on the farm .
are them steeds realfrom the farm ?
the rest of the south beach teens follows her along side hicos gun slingers from the open wagon towards the newly constructed platform as she observes the re - construction of the land over ebros farm .
the tv screen pops on displaying the familiar red barn located on the smooth clay grounds of the thelee farm then rounds of live ammo eats at the old worn wooden planks .
i saw hicos men kill them in cold - blood along with her sister rochelle with their shotguns outside the house right before we escaped in the atvs towards our farm lands .
f for farm animals .
rusk and pemona have exchanged their blood molecules using the bite - nats paint at fowlers farm .

the area enlarges pinpointing the cows emergency communications globes homing beacon , then i strike with the same right index finger an automatic button for the shortest path through the northwest corner of the farm dome .
my mother was declared brain dead at the accident point , while her limp body was kept alive on a mechanical respiratory ventilator as the farms veterinarian performed a cesarean delivering cutie me .
that is six - square miles of air travel , since i do not allow the machines to fly more than 22 miles - per - hour around the farm ecosphere for fear of deadly destruction to the income crops or startling the livestock racing then dying into the domes solar protective hot shielding .
i love my plantation and appreciate the combination of technology and nature , but running a farm does nt leave much time for fun daydreaming .
the second division is the privately owned farm ecospheres .
an ecosphere is a farm with livestock , plants , wild life , and the most important commodity crops for food .
my home starbuck plantation is called a farm ecosphere .
a farm dome harvests crops and raises livestock , then these farm products are shipped to one many designated distribution markets within a geographical region , city and state .
a farm dome harvests crops and raises livestock , then these farm products are shipped to one many designated distribution markets within a geographical region , city and state .
each farm is strategically placed north , south , east , and west .
the ecosphere is self - sustaining with production of its own meat , diary , chickens , vegetables , field crops , and farm livestock , growing 365 - days , 24 - hours , 60 - minutes , and 60 - seconds - per - year .
within the united north american government , the farm ecospheres , the military biospheres , and the residential domes are all labeled , using a former united states of america city paired with a former united states of america state .
hunts - bama is the closest city - state biosphere to my farm , starbuck plantation .
i live and work with solar sun power using all types of mechanic equipment on my farm , making my life efficient and effective , growing healthy crops and animals , since i do nt know of any other way of living and surviving on starbuck plantation .
i enjoy hearing the stories about the old farm plantation from the year 1865 , during the historical period that detailed when the united states of america fought in the great civil war between the north and south regions of the continent north american .
the dairy cows supply milk for butter and cheese , and the farm livestock include cows , pigs , horses , dogs , and cats , while the outlaying forest shelters an assortment of wild life such as birds , small rodents , coyotes , and deer .
i have inherited the farm from my grandmother , calling her , grandma starbuck .
i patiently watch the cow and calf along with the whispering farm hands for the mother and babe to leave the pasture , before making the repairs on the broken fence post .
i inspect stinky chicken coops , smelly horse stalls , and pretty cleanif ya do nt inhale the odor of dog pee and kitty dookie of animal clinics on the northwest side of my farm with an occasional social word or two with a farm human for the rest of afternoon .

each baby animal is recorded in a satellite computer database each month at the specific farm along with a cat or dog application that requires a certification letter directly from the united earth government before an individual can own a pet .
german shepherds and golden retrievers are the only puppy breeds at my farm , since these canines make the best ranch dogs for rounding up a cattle herd or finding a lost calf in the middle of thousands of acres of crop fields , woods , and forests .
traveling a wind tunnel is restricted to farm or military solar vehicles , since humans usually live their entire life of birth to death in only one biosphere .
servicing a farm ecosphere requires a satellite security network system , many types of solar hovering vehicles , and numerous floating communication globes , very expensive gifts from the united north american government to me .
the weekly farm duty ends on saturday morning with the delivery of the food and livestock at the city - state biosphere named hunts - bama , then the fun time begins .
the farm personnel shop the merchandise plazas , visit the fun carnivals , and play in the entertainment bazaars as one person stays behind .
sunday is a day of rest as stated in the holy bible for both the farm and the farm people , when grandma starbuck started that tradition .

a teenager , who owned half of a house , since grandma starbuck felt that i needed my privacy growing up on the farm .
because , all farm personnel are trained and re - trained to handle such emergencies .
grandma starbuck holds the farm together for many , many years without her beloved husband along with her infant son , since she truly lives and breathes starbuck plantation .
the existing farms , immediately , become possessions of the united earth government all over the world along with the newly construction of the protective ecospheres , covering miles of healthy crops and viable woodlands .
the united earth government donates to the farmers sets of expensive state - of - the - art farm solar equipment , and farm workers for a mass production of food operating 24 - hours - a - day , 7 - days - a - week , and 52 - weeks - a - year for the starving earthlings , living inside the biospheres .

as grandma starbuck prepares me for my lifetime role as the new administrator of starbuck plantation , my first task is to learn the mainframe programming computer language , controlling the vitality important life functions on the farm inside a glass dome .
its a typical day on the farm , harvesting crops , feeding livestock , and school learning for the children .
when the farm chores end , supper is served and people retire for the evening .
then all the functioning computer systems shut off automatically , because the application failure is constituted as a dang dire deadly emergency situation for the farm , the animals , and the people on starbuck plantation .
during the late night hours , maritza and i re - write the codes and replace my aborted programs with a series of new and improved software applications , creating that fairy tale very happy ending , because maritza saved the farm , not stupid i .
my last task is to review and adjust the permanent farm estimations , since the united north american hunts - bama distribution center sends electronically my money payments , every monday , before the arrival of my farm goods to the bank .

the starving occupants of the existing biospheres start riots and destroy public and private property when food is not available , so the united north american government is forced to interfere with the privately owned farms .
a united north american government law is passed requiring all farm owners to obtain a government certificate to manage a farm ecosphere .
a united north american government law is passed requiring all farm owners to obtain a government certificate to manage a farm ecosphere .
when many of the plantation owners ca nt pass the rigor government test composed of math , science , and legal questions , then the government appoints a certified administrator to manage the farm , supervising the weekly shipments to the starving people inside the city - state domes .
the plan is very successful as the people get food , and the farms produce better goods , while the plantation owners receive their monies .
my great - grandfather starbuck does nt cheat the city - state biospheres of vital food or play the food system for additional government monies , so he underestimates his farm goods to protect his dome , his family , and his reputation .
starbuck is a very wise man and learns to operate every united north american government computer , solar equipment , and manual device on his farm .
great - grandfather starbuck passes the farm certification with a 95 - percent completion rate and is named the farm - north bama ecosphere administrator .

my farm staff receives outstanding benefits and security as members of starbuck plantation .
the farm employees deserve time off work , since i respect that work concept .
the overseer arranges duty , sick , and leave days for the farm staff .
ming , the head member of the family calms their concerns by fibbing that it is time for the annual medical scan at the medical center then eating a free lunch and day of free shopping with no farm duties , which is against my better judgment .
as far back as i can remember there has never been another transport to ever visit my farm , snorting like a dead wild boar .
miss stone leads our farm staff towards the room with me in the rear , scanning for the anticipated enemy attack as she parks her body center stage more dull gray painted wall .
the desserts range from a dark creamy chocolate brownie to a hot red cherry pie slice on the last table , since it is picnic day for my farm personnel .
i ignore the stupid request , because i need a warm yellow sun burning my freckles while working on my farm , not here doingsomething .
the first sentence is from memory of my sunday school lessons on my farm , but the rest of the sentences will have to be paraphrased .
i am the farm helpers are having fun , believing that the test is another game .
i m going to fly back to the farm renting a car .
i finger the rental vehicle office , since my farm crew needs the solar train to sail back home to starbuck plantation , free of charge , compliments of the united north american government .

i whip my face towards the estate house and see nothing as my mental thoughts blast that there s a strange person visiting my farm for the first time in a century .
i finally get that doctoral degree in computer science as part of the educational requirements for passing the farm certificate , including academic subjects in science , legal law , and advanced mathematics , since the courses can only be taught at the academic school located in the hunts - bama biosphere .
i silently wait in the hot sunshine and amusingly watch peter explain his unexpected visit to my farm .
my overseer is declared permanent farm dome administrator in my absence .
you re in charge of the farm .
ill be safe , just worry about the farm , not me .
i m doing the right thing , since my farm is in a good pair of hands with ming , acting as the administrator .
but , grandma starbuck had taught me to stand up for my rights and be proud of my farm career .
ming would send me real food from my real farm .
my tele - practice leaves me , mentally exhausted and my farm report leaves me , emotionally homesick .

the large farm shed where we lived stood on one side of the clearing .
we move cautiously along the path , as there are a few small farm houses scattered along the road and beside them are wide fields of green .
there are probably some houses around this area too , and farms .
it is a large white farm house , with a pig pen and chicken coop to one side of the house , and a large barn towards the back of it .

* they made their way to the farm without seeing anything more of the boy .
but the farm itself was far from reassuring .
unlike the vast majority of other farms in the area , he did nt mind that the crusties had set up their community on the edges of his land .
they re requisitioning everything from all the local farms .
years of hard graft on the farm had granted him a formidable bulk , the rolled up sleeves of his shirt revealing thick , powerful arms .
beth noted that the long , twisted weal that had run down his right arm ( ahh , that was the young , stupid me , beth ; before i d got the sense to treat farm machinery with respect ! )
there s water at the farm ; its got a well .
beth had told galilee her name as their small column had set off towards the farm .
what had frobisher asked heddy back at the farm ?
the farm !
that seemed to come from the farm !
going back to the farm are we ?
* chapter 42 there was no more gunfire from the farm .
beth , galilee said , we ve either got to leave your friend here , or i m going to have to run on ahead to the farm .
* catch up as soon as you can , galilee called back as he set off at a sprint towards the farm .
gerry , we need to get to the farm as quickly as we can .
heddy , being familiar with the farm , was the one giving directions .
and the farm he looked more baffled than ever as he pointed over towards the farm sheds .

* how come the farms no longer burning ?
helping her dad run the farm .
heddy , having been raised on the farm , swung up onto a horse as easily as if she were mounting a bike .
clearing the archway , they immediately saw one of many groups of people descending on the farm .
* as galilee and beths own band moved away from the farm , the crowds who had been heading towards it now changed direction to account for their movement .
others were behind them , either skirting around the farm or walking directly through the farmyard .
i take it its in a disused farm and there are lots of barn , sheds , that kind of thing ?
even more people were descending on the farm from the opposite direction .
soon , people were milling everywhere around the farm as they got to know each other .
they chatted excitedly and noisily , either preparing the areas where they had chosen to settle down for the night , or gathering in the farms larger rooms set aside as meeting areas .
beth had felt the draining of local energy as the steel and iron taken from the old machinery littering the farm was transformed into sharp blades , guards , hilts , and pommels .
a large group of people who had newly arrived at the farm were looking somewhat bewildered and seeking help .
defend the farm !
i reckon its surrounding the farm , whatever it is .
it was a colossal circle , rapidly tightening around the farm .
they found themselves charging through yet more rats , thousands of them , all of whom had ignored the small party to continue their encircling of the farm .
and the circle was shrinking rapidly , closing in around the farm .
* as they rode towards the farm , they could see defences being rapidly , magically , constructed .
using magic himself , he sent his command flowing around the farm .
it revealed what , at first , seemed to be an overhead shot of the rat assault on the farm .
pull back so i can see the whole farm !
james did nt move even a finger , yet the view of the attack changed so that every part of the farm could be seen .
beth could now see the endless waves of rats descending on the farm .
there were still thousands of them , but nowhere near the amount the farms defenders believed they were dealing with .
just as galilee had spread his voice around the farm earlier , the image before them began to grow and extend past them .
galilees voice once again reached all the way across the farm .
the highly mechanised battalions were swiftly and proficiently moving into position outside the farm .
thankfully , the army gathering outside the farm obviously had nt attacked yet .
not that it seemed as if there were a great deal of preparation going on for deserting the farm .
but it did save our own poor little army from having to defend this poor little farm , did nt it ?
people she had seen earlier hanging around the farm were under attack from others she also recognised .
they must be attacking another side of the farm .
supporting gerry as best she could , beth led the way towards an alley leading between the farms many outbuildings .
it was a barn so ramshackle and full of holes that it had nt been deemed fit for habitation , even though it would have helped house some of those who had flocked to the farm .
there were fields , trees , lakes , seas , farms , ships , towns , and scudding clouds .
she was surrounded by naked men and women being helped to cover themselves by epona and a number of other people from the farm galilee appeared alongside her out of nowhere .
galilee frowned thoughtfully as his horse carefully negotiated one of the many muddy ditches they had to cross as they made their way to hayart farm .
beth was surprised that heddy was taking her visit back to the farm so light - heartedly ; was the reassuring , calming charm she had cast over her still working ?
fourteen the smell of hay and farm animals surrounded us as we appeared in the middle of a field .

i spend the entire day out on the farm .

he does nt look at me or say a word to me the entire way back to our farm .

at that moment , i forget that we are at hanks , that i m supposed to be learning to be independent , and think the only thing i want is to move home , work on the farm , and have little cash babies .
we talk about school , swimming , tessa and dustin , the farm , and hunting .

i also learned through these little trips that the young farm boys idrys had taken on for the winter were throwing love letters into her window attached to little stones .

but this is farm is nt it ?
idrys left after breakfast to sort a few things out with the farm boys , but he promised he would return in the evening to advise me on henris escape .

you , me , bampi , leighton , blod , ness , the two farm boys , mam began , hesitating a moment , and doctor bickerstaff .
i plastered half a smile to my face as idryss two farm boys came to sit down , their mouths hanging open as they stared at the beautiful food mam had prepared in my honour .
the farm boys mouths dropped once again at the arrival of blod , apparently even more delicious than the party food .
the young doctor settled himself as far away from us as possible at the other end of the table and accepted a small beer as he enquired with one of the farm boys after his fathers health .
said one of the farm boys , setting them both off into sniggers .
i looked away from the happy scene , feeling like my throat was going to close up , only to notice a figure i had nt seen for a long time coming towards us through the old farm buildings .
ness shouted gleefully , making leighton and the farm boys giggle .
* * * idrys suggested that henri could stay with him at the cottage across the pasture and help out on the farm , an idea that henri and i were elated with .

despite the low rations and the lack of money , idrys managed to get henri kitted out with some proper clothes and put him to good use on the farm .
for the first day in all the months i d lived in the farm house , blods radio was silent .
idrys was making all of the arrangements to spare his daughter the horror , so when henri was occupied with picking up the slack out on the farm , i started spending a lot of time with ness fach in the summer sun where i could see him going by as he worked .
ness fach watched him as she sucked on her lolly , her huge eyes travelling over his face with the same keen interest she reserved for clouds and farm animals .
henri got in beside the doctor and waved to me as the farm truck set off down the cobbles .
leigh had run into our mother walking up the big hill to reach the farm house and then run all the way on to be the first one to tell us all of her arrival , so after he had heard the tales of the on - going bombing in london he abruptly fell asleep on the old sofa next to mum .
she was sitting at the table with idrys and me as we cradled cups of steaming tea against the cold november wind that was cascading through every crack in the doors and windows of the little farm house .
but mam says i ca nt have a house for dolly til i m five , she was explaining , bampis going to build it , but he wants to build me a farm .

he s retired now , to the farm ; that s the plain of three pillars .
beyond the cobble platform and the three stone pillars , beneath a big blue sky and a bright yellow sun , where animals made animal noises and leafy green vegetables grew leafy and green , a little farm stood as the single most prominent feature on an otherwise uninhabited landscape .
this one is a fixed structure , brock answered , up to date model with old fashioned aesthetics to stay in keeping with the farm .
beyond the polished floors and the three reception rooms , below the wide staircase leading to eight bedrooms and their eight adjoining en suites , past the downstairs cloakroom , grand dining room , and very big country style kitchen where grandpa bilson was preparing dinner , drinking wine , and singing in a funny language , lay an undulating outside land of green pastures , bordering forests , and free - range farm animals all strangely scarred with the odd divot taken out from various parts of their hides .
he wondered now if he should have stayed back on the farm after all , safely tucked away and relaxing on the plain of three pillars , waiting calmly for grandpa bilson to figure out a way back to england ; although barry appeared confident and completely at ease considering their situation , and that in itself was partly reassuring .

mama pauses for beauty as i nod my skull , once accepting the silence cue of the upcoming academic lecture that mama performs when she s in a bad mood that has been caused by her temporary leg injury because she loves to ride around the farm barking orders like a mama dog to the farm workers instead of cooped up inside the house .

i gently attack the icing with the jagged teeth of the knife because this is my birthday party and mama started this stupid tradition when i was four years old and could hold the knife without endangering her or me as i deeply push the sharp blade into the soft cake down to the foiled - cover hardwood that holds a fifteen pound sweet monster of flour , sugar , and eggs then the farm baker removes the first piece from my art work handing off to me since i m princess for the day .
the paid farm workers cheer , laugh , and hum as i consume the first big bite of the first big piece of cake while the icing coats both my lips .

i stomp carefully each boot toe ensuring i do nt trip and fall and break my cell phone because it will die first before my cute button nose slams into the polished hardwood floor of the united methodist church in apollo , alabama off cedar road near bobby joe and billy jacks farm creating a puddle of yucky red blood while wearing my old lavender cotton jumper paired with a white short sleeved soft cotton t - shirt and my new lavender and black cowgirl boots .

i swing my face towards my house which blazes like a tiny village against the surrounding walls of midnight blue sky of darkness with the outside big baseball field - type flood pole lights up high and the small bulbs cupped into the iron decorative holders around the porch signaling rest time on the farm from a hard days work as cinta and i shuffle near the plants away from garth then cinta warns .
i wrap the webbing around my body for safety then slowly twirl the atv to my left rolling the tires over 100 % of plushy smooth paved road instead of rough loose gravel and uneven dirt pods as i quickly swirl the wheel straight and parallel with the road ditches and freshly cut grass by the farm workers for a smooth ride on oak street since garths sweet directions are too long .
the west wall holds small amount of clucks who are the really smart kids that are easily taunted and mocked like real chicken hens on a farm then the east wall holds the musicians like me who are made of the majorettes and dance team girls who like to flaunt with their guys during class time instead of pay attention to the teacher .

the hazards of living in the mountains and near a cow farm .
she would continue to work on her fathers farm , the way it should be .
cooking and cleaning , helping to run a farm .
she knew that the chickens would not lay their eggs until around midday , and even then her mother and serah would collect them , so erris would instead deal with the rest of the farms livestock , before any of her siblings got there .
the animals were , after all , the things that erris loved most about living on the farm .
she had spent all of her nearly sixteen years on her parents farm ; only leaving for occasional trips to town on special occasions , and one unfortunately memorable trip to vhyindar , reges capital city .
she would live on a farm for the rest of her life .
still , she had one animal down , and the rest of the farm to feed .
the chickens probably had nt even left their shady coop to parade around the yard yet , and there would be no eggs to collect until midday or so , so erris headed for the farms sedate cow , ms .
joahn , erris youngest sister , had her first chance to name one of the farm animals four years ago when they had bought ms .
no , erris thought , and not for the first time , she should have been given exclusive naming rights to all the farms animals .
she would certainly name all her own animals when she had her own farm .
she always felt bad eating meat , because it inevitably came from one of the farms animals .
he was the oldest pig on the farm at the time .
there was a whole days work for everyone on the farm , from cleaning and cooking , to caring for the animals and repairing tools , to preparing for next months harvest .
erris father , johan , left immediately for his tool shed , to spend more time with his new project , while her brother jayke and his wife yolan retired to their home , built not far from the farms main house .
their house was standard for a farm , as far as she could tell .

paper and ink were not a staple of farm life .
at only an eight - hour walk away , oortains copse was the closest village to the farm , but it stood in rognia .
it would be completely un - wearable around the farm , of course , but maybe when her chest had filled out some more her mother and sisters had , so surely hers would someday too .
yolan came from a farm some four hours away from home , and erris had only seen her twice before she and jayke were married .
the other part of why erris had chosen oortains copse for her birthday , not counting being able to see the soldiers ( that came only from a small , unfamiliar but slowly growing part of her mind ) , was that oortains copse was different from the other little villages that dotted the regan and rognian countrysides within a days walk of the farm .
these were not the sixteen year old recruits who did the rounds of the farms and small towns , giving out news and keeping the peace , these soldiers were all older , more experienced than that .
it placed them in one of the small , patchy forests that dotted the path from oortains copse to the farm , but gave no reason for the stop .
they would go to sleep , and wake up early the next morning , and farm life would continue , and erris would never ask to leave the farm again .
they would go to sleep , and wake up early the next morning , and farm life would continue , and erris would never ask to leave the farm again .
staen wondered absently if any of the farm animals were still alive .
which meant she needed to find a farm , a village , even a cottage , andwell , she could worry about how to get what she needed when she found somewhere to get them from .

i just agro farm in outland for like hours with some serious aoe .
my brains working faster than a click farm worker and uneasy feelings are getting the best of me .
one would think we were farm animals .
there are the new houses , and solar panels everywhere , and wind turbines on the clifftops , and all the veggie gardens , and cyclists everywhere , and the fact baytown is now three villages with farms in between .
the treaty also set up the global clean energy fund to pay for solar power stations and wind farms ; and the smaller families program to reduce the worlds population ; and the wilderness pact to create great wild regions where nature could thrive away from people .
for example , all parts of a slaughtered farm animal would be used in some way , either directly by the farmer 's family or through trading it for something they did need .
# # # # # # # # the following monday found will and izzy circling invisibly over a farm a couple of kilometers east of coronation , alberta .
izzy had selected this particular farm to watch because it was situated all by itself well outside of town and therefore not under the possible scrutiny of neighbours .
the farmer 's wife and her three farm hands were slowly prying themselves off the rough timbers of the barn 's floor , their eyes still crazy , mouths opening and closing soundlessly , hands clasped around their heads now .
while izzy went into the field to retrieve her moccasins , her feet now protected by a set of wooden clogs , will asked the farm lady about the rusty iron lying around the barn and would they like to get rid of it ?
will started taking all the iron and steel he could grab and ferrying it up to the top of mount robson where he had secreted the other metals he had taken from coronation farms .

in still others , she was in a small cart , in a farm setting , and the cart was hitched to one or another of a pair of goats garlic and rosemary .

chapter 21 - revelations he had his fathers farm ute ; not the new one that had carried the grand gourd in the parade .
the carpet , being the floor of a farm ute , was barely visible through bits of cane trash , hand tools , lolly wrappers , empty drink bottles and random orders of plain dirt .
he could be anywhere on the vast acreages of his farm !
he should sell the whole farm , in fact .
he s worked like a dray horse , it seems , every day of his life , trying to maintain these inherited farms and to establish some kind of standing in the community .
he wants to walk away now , from this farm , from this town , from the little voice in the telephone , from the disappointed look that he ever fears to see in vivians eyes .

he tries to steady his mind , as he creeps along with the boy on his shoulder , by forcing his attention onto normal things ; farm jobs .
he has , after all , been shooting out pests on this farm for years wallabies , feral pigs and the occasional dingo .
james quickly thought about the change of scenery that the two - hour drive to the turkey farm where he grew up would bring .
the turkey farm , a place where he was no longer welcome .
simon had traced james footsteps everywhere on the farm , despite all the turkey shit , the thickness of blood in the air -- the dog was a golden shadow of james soul , a gift from his mother after she got back from the hospital , and the dog had followed james in blind pilgrimage .
james was eighteen , and not welcome at the farm to which his father moved back , and which was then put up for sale before his mothers body was a year decomposed .
he thought of simon and his flowing , golden coat with the thin white stripe of fur on his belly that curled at his neck , ( almost like a question mark ) and how the dog would smile while he panted after a long run on the farm and then look up at james with gratitude .
simon barking from back at the farm .
it smelled surprisingly clean , like the turkey farm when they got fresh hay , or when corn was freshly spread .
i grew up on a farm , said james , usually reluctant to say such a thing ; in fact , usually rebelling against it .
a turkey farm .
lester did nt know james had grown up on a farm and saw dead animals , dead turkeys , by the thousands .
he figured simon loved the farm , like him , loved the land and activity , but felt the farmhouse was cursed .
it was the farmhouse where things were warped ; it was the farm that was natural .
the harmony could even be found tucked into the memories of living at the farm -- in the back of the farm where he would hide in the deep woods by the fence , and especially the day he had been drinking and taken some acid .
the harmony could even be found tucked into the memories of living at the farm -- in the back of the farm where he would hide in the deep woods by the fence , and especially the day he had been drinking and taken some acid .
the animals on the farm knew they were here to be slaughtered for someone else , and were living in terror everyday .
or better yet , he could just keep driving the two hours to the farm and unleash the pit bull on his dad .
i can always get drunk tomorrow and crawl back to the farm to see what happens .
i grew up on a turkey farm , so i ve smelled a lot worse than stinking drunks like you ve got here .
maybe he could bring the pit bull to roam free on his dads farm and just let him live on the fenced - in range .
the park had a lake and hiking trails , and was located in a rural , wooded area where the suburbs gave way to farms and pastures .
tom asked , as he pulled over near an abandoned , fenced - in farm .
you know i grew up a ways from here on a turkey farm -- my family owned it and contracted most of the work out to cheap , migrant labor .
which part , the farm or the stumbling ?
that was one thing the farm had going for it , the turkeys could roam , they were nt stuffed inside a barn where they ended up pecking each others eyes out and becoming cannibals like some other places .
james imagined his dad back in the farmhouse , wondering if he kept the farm going , or if he was sitting in his chair watching tv and making a list of people who had wronged him and plotting revenge .
he inched his nose into the air and waited for the smell of the farm to appear from the distance , as if some unfelt wind , whose current ran slow but unnoticed , could lift the scent of turkey shit , muddy feathers , hay and corn from miles away .
james longed to smell the farm again , wished he could swim in it once more , but his nose came up blank .
my animal experience from the farm really helped me out , and if i attend some school and get more training , there s room for advancement .
i m not in his office anymore , james reminded himself , not crawling back to treatment because i have no other place to stay , and i sure as hell am not gon na beg my dad to move back into the farm .
he entered his code , 4286 , his address from back at the farm , and took out forty dollars of the two hundred he had in savings , telling himself whatever he spent on ra would be worth it .
that was the address where james grew up , and the drive up to the state park might take them right by the farm , depending on which way ra drove .
just sneak a glance and do nt say a word , james told himself , sneak a quick glance and let the quick snapshot of the farm burn in your memory banks .
they would nt be driving by the farm this way , and james feelings were mixed with regret and relief .
he always wanted to make it clear we owned and lived on the farm ; we did nt work it , just a regular business owner .
they walked back out to the front , and the sound of tires on gravel pulling into the farm shocked james systems and sent his nerves on alert .
james noticed two strangers in the front seat , two strangers who were lost and using the farm to change directions .
james dreamt that he and ra had left the farm yesterday and had forgotten about madison .
the dog sat alone night after night wondering why james had left her at the farm to die and squealed for help at the fence with sad eyes .
the smell of rotting , human flesh was coming from way in the back of the farm , and this attracted the starving dog .
the face of james dad as he lay dead in the back of the farm was the last image james saw in his dream before he awoke with a jolt .
when they went out to the farm later that day , james would make sure to walk back to see if his dads body was really lying there dead on the farm .
when they went out to the farm later that day , james would make sure to walk back to see if his dads body was really lying there dead on the farm .
and if something does happen that you get ownership of the farm you can list it with me .
i went by the farm and it looks empty .
getting back to the farm never left his brain all throughout the workday , and james waited for five oclock with a stomachache of anxiety .

` ` it was parked on the clay road up the valley from ryland 's farm .
` ` the cessna took off on an unreported flight from the ryland farm and crashed twenty - two minutes later . ''
could your radar have picked up a flight from the same farm if it had taken place ? ''
` ` we have a reading from the farm on saturday morning .
apparently it flew back to the farm where the signal was lost again . ''
it 's like our own little world and i can forget about grant , the farm , everything .
` ` the bank 's about to foreclose on the farm mortgage .
` ` grant was the only son and had the farm just handed onto him when his father died ten years ago .
* lavina 's next big hurdle was visiting the farm .
the immediate neighbours had helped by feeding the dogs and supervising the farm animals since her disappearance and the subsequent news of grant 's death .
she had accepted bob and fiona mcpherson 's offer to continue to keep an eye on the farm as she did not feel up to staying in her own home .
he left him controlling interest in the family farm but not ownership . ''
he knew if i walked out on him the farm would go , too . ''
` ` the only mistake your father - in - law made was to give grant controlling interest , which meant he could run the farm as he wished without consulting you .
` ` i doubt if we can save the farm , lavina but you wo n't be left destitute . ''
he needed me or he 'd lose the farm .
it was my farm he was ruining , not his . ''
now there were the farm problems to solve .
* lavina was home in the apartment going through a pile of farm financial documents when there was a knock on the door .
` ` when the farm sale goes through i can use the money left to pay off the mortgage here . ''
apparently , the farm was poorly managed .
you can certainly sell the spring lambs , but ca n't sell all your farm animals together at auction . ''
` ` and only on the farm tracks except the steep back one until the weather improves . ''
lavina had insisted steve help her select the farm manager and they 'd checked out the applicants and had interviews the week earlier .
their final selection was barrie dey , a third year university student who had to complete three month 's practical work on a high country farm as part of his bachelor of agriculture degree .
cathy took her eyes off the track and gazed over the farm .
in the valley to their right the roof of the farm house could be seen amongst tall trees and hedges while further back , the gravel road wound away with the upper forks road school just visible in the distance .
now , what would she be doing crossing our farm ? ''
i was so lonely here on the farm and grant was no help . ''
she continued with a brief description of hers and cathy 's life , a little about the school before it closed and comments about the farm .
i parked at your place and walked across the farm .
` ` later , steve can show barrie around the farm .
` ` you said you could see no way out of having the farm sold to pay all the debts . ''
` ` i had a look at those figures and also survey sheets of the farm .
` ` the neighbour 's farm was sold out about twelve years ago and we bought that top plateau .
` ` could n't you keep that and sell the rest of the farm ? ''
` ` not as a farm maybe , but that cave would make a great tourist track .
we could start off in a small way by using the school as a tourist lodge or perhaps one for school parties , bring them through the cave , visit a sheep farm in operation , fly visitors on scenic flights and '' ` ` you 're serious , are n't you ? ''
one of the main incomes for the farm was the sale of lambs for overseas meat markets .
the more lambs safely born and growing , the more profits for the farm .
lamb percentages , the percentage of live births per ewe , were up ten percent from the last season grant or , in reality lavina , ran the farm even though the weather had been cold and drizzling for two weeks .
he 'd walk through the farm , help ewes having birth difficulties , bring home - orphaned lambs and look after the animals .
spring was the busiest time of the farm year but in many ways , the most rewarding .
by mid - morning steve , cathy and lavina would arrive at the farm and barrie would have the next thirty hours off .
saturday night would be spent at her flat and , after a leisurely sunday , she would follow him back to the farm in her car .
steve leaped out from the sheets and grabbed his warm farm clothes .
i think he 'd been talking to jack trent , the government farm advisor .
he 's agreed to refinance the farm mortgage and has put the foreclosure on indefinite hold . ''
` ` you mean '' ` ` there will be no forced sale of the farm .
her new boyfriend , barrie dey is the newly appointed manager of lavina 's ryland 's farm . ''
` ` he played around while his wife ran the farm .
the bank was about to foreclose and sell the farm under him . ''
both have new partners , the farm is refinanced and the boyfriend is employed as manager .
i also found out the farm was in lavina ryland 's name but ryland had controlling interest . ''
` ` so he was running her farm into the ground ? ''
anyhow , she said in her note she was going to the farm .
the note was written at lunchtime so she should have reached the farm by now , steve .
` ` if we have n't heard from her by then we 'll drive out to the farm ! ''
` ` right , '' replied lavina and rang the farm back again .
like lavina , he realized janice would be at the farm if she 'd come straight out .
` ` what about further up the road past the farm ? ''
` ` but why would she go past the farm ? ''
` ` so why did n't she get to the farm ? ''
nothing had been found , not even footprints and the whole roadside , streambed and lower farm had been searched .
` ` i know who did it , '' cathy said a few moments later as they drove slowly up the road beyond the farm and pulled into a picnic site .
grant had had several over night flights but had told her it was to try to get the farm refinanced .
` ` i never saw anything stored anywhere on the farm . ''
the police walked over the farm , searched the school , which had been included in the warrant , and discovered janice 's wrecked car in the gully .
i believe they 're also considering a complaint about the search through their personal property on the farm . ''
` ` they have it on the farm and are prepared to hand it over to the police '' ` ` shit !
the four police officers and two civilians were met by the farm 's inhabitants and escorted into the implement shed where stein introduced doctor andre van den waardt , curator of the metropolitan art gallery and his assistant , an austere plump woman in her late forties .
` ` so that 's what the farm search was for ? ''
we want to substitute this for the real one and leave it on the farm . ''
` ` we plan to have undercover agents on the farm all the time .
one can be employed as a worker to help barrie out while the others will maintain constant watch over the farm .
we 'll also be setting up electronic communications and tracking devices to cover the farm .
on the farm front , barrie had been offered and accepted the position as permanent manager and janice had moved in with him over the university holidays .
` ` lavina , '' she cried , ` ` i ' ve just arrived at the farm .
an open wool bale stood in its iron frame and was half filled with woolly tails , recently cut off the farm lambs , while others were in a tidy pile on the floor as if barrie was in the middle of sorting and counting them .
another frightening few moments passed as she had to open a farm gate but then it was only a short journey to park behind the tin swimming pool fence .
a stationary vehicle was directly in front of them blocking the road just beyond the farm driveway .
barrie slid left behind the old farm land rover and crawled around the edge of the vehicle .
how far is it back to the farm ? ''
she 'd driven the old land rover on the farm for months now ; it was completely illegal but this was an emergency .
she 'd drive herself out to the farm .
cathy estimated it would take about fifteen minutes to reach the farm , began to regain her confidence and went a little faster until she arrived at the gravel road .
` ` that was quite a haul out at the farm pat but now i want you to concentrate on the ryland murder , '' inspector harold matthews said as he sat in his office .
` ` since the ransacking of ryland 's farm , i ' ve added petra roberts to the list .
they 'd helped janice clean up the farm house , an odd jobs man had been employed to repair the kicked in wall and two couches had to be replaced .
grant was constructing a new fence along the farm 's road frontage when nancy drove up in her mercedes , pulled to the roadside and walked across to the tractor her ex - husband was using to drill the postholes .
` ` i want a package flown down from auckland and stored on the farm for a few months ` ` * ` ` so you organized the art theft ? ''
lavina gasped after nancy finished her account of how she 'd used grant to fly the rubens to the farm .
* chapter 23 janice , the manager of upper forks road lodge , guided the emerson heights middle school girls through the cave on the farm .
* richard ludlow 's farm was well kept with a modest house perched on a small hill .
janice called and walked over to the black farm dog chained to a kennel .
she 's met a fine young man who is now the manager of my family farm .
* in the days that followed the wedding , richard ludlow became a regular visitor to their farm ... except on sundays ` ` i guess dad ca n't change his beliefs , entirely , '' janice said .
they inherited their farm from their father , jacob gallows - a well - respected resident who sadly passed away only two years ago .
well swing by the gallows farms on the way .
he has visited this small farm numerous times before to buy eggs .
his trusty crop duster was his paying job and he knew every inch of the large farms in orange and chatham counties and beyond , where he was paid to spray the acres of new farm crops .

she did nt live there , but she spent most her free time at the farm .
farming was not a well - paying profession in the 1960s , especially on a small farm of 200 acres .
grandfather strong was forced to sell 150 acres of it to cover growing farm debts and pay the mortgage off which freed the remaining 60 acres of all debt .
the strongs were somewhat isolated living on a farm ; no one lived close enough to really know them or miss them after the accident .
he withdrew enough once a month to pay for farm upkeep , food and take care of any bills .
he told the bank personnel that she was still at home on the farm , and still doing very poorly .
i have to visit grandpa and dad at the farm , and i will be spending a few days with you guys in l.a . on the way .
his driving interest for the rest of that year was getting lady dandy down to marties boyfriends farm in north carolina for the new years eve fly - in and finally meeting his ham radio buddy .

ben and oprah smart visited preston strongs farm for their summer vacation that year .
she was also looking forward to flying her newly purchased pilatus across country to prestons farm to attend the friendly fly - in over christmas and the new year .
carlos also had a mustang , and he had shipped another 20,000 rounds of his ammo for storage at the strong farm .
he suddenly realized if somebody puts a couple of rounds into this hangar , there wo nt be much farm left .
she drove into work in the old 1980 ford big block farm truck the next day and got the forklift loaded onto its bed .
the farm had an old cattle loading ramp that was nothing more than an ancient heap of hardened rock , and she and preston managed to off - load the forklift and move the ammo out of the hangar .
it was perfect to serve as the farms new temporary munitions dump for the upcoming festivities .
to the south of prestons farm was a lake , a natural forest , and the nc64 highway two miles away .
to the southeast and east was a forest reserve and no farms or houses for three miles .
lots of new people in delivery trucks were visiting the farm , and preston never liked that .
he owned a large farm passed down to him from his father , my grandfather .
the safe had a roll of money in it and fake papers for the farm , my mother told me later .
my mother looked around the area and finally paid cash for a small farm with a ranch house .
the farm was a dozen acres and the house was only a few years old .
it was a nice farm with beautiful views about 20 miles south of medellin and pretty close to her family .
he even worked out that several different gangs had killed over a hundred farmers , taken over their farms , and emptied their accounts .
we knew he also had another five dozen men living on several other farms he had commandeered after killing my father .
we monitored it and then attacked five farms the day after the account went back to zero .
she forced him at gunpoint to tell her how many gang members were left at the farm , where the leader was , and when was he going to return .
sell our farm .
we left for america with everything we had , even the money we got for my parents farm .
when i was given the money from the sale of our old farm in florencia , i did not want to spend the money .
they then went about checking the well where the farm got its water , cleaned the filters , and made sure everything was in good order .
if you get tired of him , my farm is next door .
i have a trailer and joe came over yesterday with a tractor and brought them on the trailer over to his farm .
military aircraft also tended to stay away from commercial flight lanes , and preston did not often see military flights over the farm .
but i bet you $ 500 that you ca nt do it before you leave the farm in the new year .
he was the last expected outside visitor , and from then on prestons farm was off limits to anybody other than invited guests .
chapter 14 the fly - in over christmas and new years eve christmas morning arrived in north carolina at the strong farm with its usual sleepiness , the sun attempting its cold rise over the horizon at 7:44 a.m .
david was sleeping at joes farm in the guest room .
the aircraft noises kept away most of the larger animals , and half of the farm had been fenced in many years ago .
they were gone in two minutes and the farm suddenly became quiet and peaceful with no one home , not even faithful oliver .
most of the farm was desolate and natural bush .
the two farms were the only houses on the road and on the side of the tarred feeder road stood their mail boxes .

the eastern edge of jordan lake was only 100 yards away from the road entrance , and much of the property south of the farms was part lake itselfa natural barrier for most of the farms southern and western boundaries .
within an hour and a half , they arrived back at the farm gate and preston pushed the remote on the sun visor to let them through .
martie and i work hard , and so does joe next door , just to keep our farms intact .
he let her lean forward and the rotor blades bit into the wind and climbed quickly in a west - northwest direction , directly over joes farm and then over the lake .
one out - going raleigh flight dove into jordan lake a couple of miles south of prestons farm .
an incoming flight , 12 miles east of prestons farm , also fell to earth , exploded in a wooded area , and then swept through a housing community killing dozens .
it became the only beacon of light as the whole area went black , except for prestons and joes farms .
* * * dawn at the strong farm was relatively normal .
preston asked buck to set the second radio to the farms frequency , and martie returned a call saying that the reception was perfect and that she and her father would be monitoring the radio .
then the radio tuned into the farms frequency lit up .
the gauges wo nt show how much we put in , and your gauges on the farm wo nt either , but full tanks are full tanks .
i think we have a week to arm ourselves and protect what we have at your farm .
the farm became busy for a few minutes as everybody got back at once .
we have a farm in north carolina that i m going to turn into a civilian air force base .
an hour later , half way to prestons farm , pete came on the air .
they already had two of the airports jet - fuel tankers by the side of the farms fuel depot .

ten days went by and i was beginning to feel a tentative relief when stories appeared in the papers about a furtive wild man who had been sighted around farms in the region , stealing from orchards and gardens .
the wild man of arkham has apparently struck once more , this time at summers farm .
mr . summer said he spotted a shambling form among the farms outbuildings at dusk on wednesday , but could not see it clearly enough to furnish a description .
similar thefts have been reported from other farms between arkham and bolton this summer .
who was at summers farm ?
and what s more , i would nt assume all these supposed thefts from farms were done by hocks .
they were mainly farm and factory workers , and their illnesses and ailments were of the crude variety common among such folk .
except that this time it would not be an itinerant farm labourer or an unknown tramp , but a prominent physician of the town .
there was nothing to show why anyone had ever thought it necessary to build them here , no farm no industry and as far as he could see no other anything except for mile upon mile of rolling grass covered valley .
he pointed to the old farm gate picked out by the headlights .
he wiped his sweaty hands on his jacket and watched as a big fat man with a beard and long straggly hair appeared from the side of the bus and started to open the farm gate .
however , where they ended up was n't a police motorway depot , but at a derelict farm .
the four band members were then woken up and led away to one of the farm buildings .
i was now moving past farms and roads , with the odd house here and there .
it was early evening and the sun was just kissing the horizon when maxi and nick were heading back after a visit to the conch farm , when they tripped over raphael .
the hedges around the field had been allowed to grow wild , and there was a farm gate against which a beefy looking man leaned , chain - smoking and muttering into a mobile phone from time to time .
he had driven to the farm gates .
he felt uncomfortable too , especially since he knew his bosses were watching him through the glass , frost obviously dismissing him as just some rookie kid , wet behind the ears and fresh from the farm .

from the vantage of an elevated freeway packed with rows of sleek hondas and toyotas sparkling in the cold december sunshine , we could see the silhouettes of cluster after cluster of modernistic concrete towers , an urban complex of a hundred and fifty thousand souls rising above what was , only a few short years ago , mostly farms .

it came on slowly , passed the farm entrance towards the bridge .
old men and women and children all struggling on despite their exhaustion , women grey with dust and fatigue carrying a baby in one arm and leading a weary child with the other , horses lame and tired , some people apparently wounded by bombs or bullets being jolted along on a farm cart , all fleeing from the dreaded invader towards some elusive refuge ahead of them .

there were fields of corn and orchards with white farms dotted here and there , and over on the right above some trees i could see the tall spire of a village church standing upright in the golden morning light .
i decided that i should be much too conspicuous in the village at that early hour , particularly with my blood - stained tunic and battered face and i made up my mind to go to a farm and ask for help .
a little further on i saw a small cluster of farm buildings with a few trees on one side and i walked across an orchard and sat down under the trees to wait , intending to see if the occupants were likely looking people before approaching them ; for all i knew german soldiers might be billeted there though it seemed unlikely .

* * * * * * from where i lay there was a good view over the small farm buildings to the countryside beyond .
they were still several hundred yards away , but they came on briskly and when they reached the orchard i saw a man beckon two or three others and then the little group approached the farm while the rest of the line continued its sweep .
the men were almost in the farm now and i could see clearly their grey green uniforms and leather boots .
he then moved out of my line of vision and i heard the scraping and banging of various farm implements being moved as he searched round the building .
the memory of that evening in the little french farm will remain clear in my memory till i die , madame cormier and i standing beside an old wireless and listening with feelings that i can not describe to the one voice in europe that still defied the german might .
a few farm carts laden with vegetables passed on their way towards the village and now and again german lorries and cars drove past at high speed sounding their horns impatiently whenever a cart was rather slow in pulling into the side of the road .
it struck me that there was something in common between this man and those soldiers who had searched the farm , an indefinable quality of toughness and arrogance and also , i must admit , of hard efficiency .
two farm carts were drawn up on the far side of the bridge and several german soldiers stood round them evidently questioning the occupants .

alex continues down the hartland road until he comes to a junction signposted for hartland point , turns the car round and drives back past the farm entrance .
as he and billy walk down the lane towards the farm alex checks to make sure that there are no cars approaching and hands billy the spare gun .
alex talks quietly as they walk on towards the farm entrance .
alex continues walking towards the farm .
the lane narrows as alex and billy approach the stand of cottages just before the sillick farm gate .
the lions on top of the pillars are laying down with the lamb , and sillick farm breathes softly in the quiet drift of the morning , but alex is intent on one thing only , on the hauling - in of the long line of revenge .
a skinny , lime green fiat , pure rust on wheels , bears down on the gun fighters like an ancient western stage coach , flinging up clouds of dust as the driver puts the wheels into the gutter on the bend by the farm .
the farm track runs down for twenty or thirty yards between two fields and then opens out into a wider , gravelled area in front of a derelict farmhouse .
the only cover is a lichen covered two bar stock fence running the short length of the lane to the farm house .
he is pressed down and back into the damp , dewy fringe running along the farm lane .
the bag in the farm house doorway momentarily stops the music in billy 's head .
the sound of car tyres , the hedgerow waltz of the dude ranchers and the sound of bile , all of these things are congested , in shadow , and in the absence of breakfasting travellers , the owner of the cottage nearest the farm steps out onto her drive to see if the world on her doorstep really is as depraved as the daily mail describes it .
for the first time in all the years that he has owned sillick farm , he notices the ornate ridge tiles that run along the apex of the barn roof and he tries to smile , but none of his facial muscles seem to work anymore .
jock is facing the wrong way as the lexus speeds up to the corner by the barn and the old farm house and turns right , heading up the lane towards the main clovelly road .
alex is a couple of metres further down the lane towards the farm house , crouched down by the fence .
sillick farm has been a place of ghosts for too long for there to be a welcome on the door mat .
there is something else , though , something heavy and deep , that prevents his feet from moving back up the lane , something dark and compelling drawing him down towards the farm courtyard .
the old farm house looks cold and uninviting , brooding over the loss of past generations of pig breeders .
he is drawn downwards , taking slow steps , descending the slight incline of the lane , past the farm house door and on towards the courtyard .
at the far end of the farm house a low wall sticks out from the front of an old coach house .
billy has to swing out into the lane , away from the comfort of the fence at the front of the farm house garden .
somewhere in the bright blue sky a buzzard calls , searching for carrion , unaware of the rich pickings that lay prostrate on the courtyard floor at sillick farm .
billy is aware of death , aware of the metallic smell on the breeze , and with little bex by his side , with the ghost girl in his arms , he sits next to a piece of rusting , fang - toothed farm machinery with a gun barrel pressed against his temple .
there is a patrol car parked across the entrance to sillick farm , and a traffic cop leans against the door with his arms folded across his chest .
the lane is rapidly filled with crouching bodies , bodies intent on tracing every last splash of blood on the unmade farm road , on grass and fence posts .
south along the back of the far barn , walking slowly , looking into angles of shadow and watching for sudden shifts in light , one of the uniformed constables makes his way toward the field at the bottom of the farm complex .
the sound of cars and sirens , the sound of someone knocking on her front porch was one hell of a fright , but not half as bad as the sight of the man running up the old farm lane with that gun in his hand .

i think they bathed more than farm people , and her passion for cleanliness had rubbed off on my father .

at first my father had not been sympathetic ; rat snakes are harmless and just a part of life on the farm .
it was exciting to have so many strangers on our farm for the harvest , hut the enthusiasm was dampened by the reality that we would spend most of the next twelve hours unshielded in the sun , bent over , picking until our fingers bled .
these were locals who went from farm to farm looking for the best deal .
after the incident with the rat snake , i watched every step around our farm , especially in the fields , since there were cottonmouths near the river .

so for a whole morning i drove around in rural ohio with mary anne bishop , looking at fields and fences and run - down farmhouses , thinking about how cold and isolated some of these farms would be in winter , how the land would look covered with snow .
none of these farms was martin 's .
i met many nice people who really wanted to sell their farms , and felt sorry for most of them , victims of our economic times .
but i could n't afford all those farms .
` ` for martin 's wedding present , '' i said steadily , ` ` i want to buy him the farm he grew up on .
i have n't told the realtor i want to see this one particular farm because of course she 'll know i want it for some reason , and joseph flocken wo n't sell to me if he knows i ' m going to give it to martin . ''
` ` it 's a good idea , getting the farm for him , '' she began .
` ` okay , the farm is south of town on route 8 , and you ca n't see the house from the road , but there 's a mailbox with ' flocken ' on it by the gate . ''
i asked her which farms we were to see today , looked at the spec sheets , and asked that we see the one on route 8 first .
i looked carefully at each mailbox as we passed , and spotted one labeled ` ` flocken '' just before the farm we 'd come to see , which we toured quickly .
` ` oh , that 's the bartell farm , '' she said instantly .
` ` i ' ve heard he wants to move , so even though he has n't listed the farm , we can check . ''
` ` this lady is in the market for a farm , and she wanted to know if she could take a look at yours . ''
` ` we want to buy a farm in this area that needs work , a secluded farm that we can renovate .
` ` we want to buy a farm in this area that needs work , a secluded farm that we can renovate .
` ` why this farm ? ''
so great was my wish to be away that i negotiated for the farm in an abstract way .
all it took was someone asking , someone he was convinced barby and martin would not want the farm to go to .
the chances seemed distant that someone would find out the real reason i wanted the farm , someone who liked joseph flocken enough to tell him .
and martin had gone to stay on that isolated farm in ohio with a man he hated , just to have a familiar place to recover .
she had come over in blue jeans and a t - shirt and sneakers , looking like a healthy farm girl who tossed bales of hay up to the loft with her bare hands .
the farm was far out in the country , they emphasized , and it was so hard for hugh to get around .
` ` i wonder if the police have been out there , to the farm , '' i said , the idea sort of slipping into my head sideways .
` ` ah - out at the old farm , '' martin said , not taking his eyes off me .
i think we would be better off out at the farm . ''
` ` you might want to call margaret and luke granberry when you get out to the farm , '' dennis suggested .
luke pretends to farm , and margaret pretends to farm right along with him .
then we were on our way to the farm where martin had grown up , where he 'd lived until he 'd gone to vietnam .
it was the widowed joseph i 'd had to see in order to purchase the farm i 'd given back to martin as a wedding present .
the bartell farm was south of town on route 8 , further out than i remembered .
actually , the farm seemed forlorn and bleak , out here in the winter countryside .
we have the farm to the south of here . ''
` ` we can just barely see the farm from our house , and we noticed more lights on tonight than there have been , so we felt we ought to check it out , '' margaret said .
but out here in farm country , with the fireplace in the living room that at least also served our bedroom upstairs , we 'd have to do a lot of the fetching and carrying if our electricity went out .
maybe martin had thought of something to improve the farm 's security .
when martin told me the story , and it was one he hated to remember , it was because he was explaining why his family farm was in the hands of a man who hated him .
` ` unless they go across the fields all the way to our farm , i think they 'll end in that little grove of trees in that hollow , '' she said .
` ` that 's the boundary between the farms .
i was grateful to see the entrance to the farm , and even more grateful when i entered the kitchen to find rory intact and martin and karl apparently holding on to their tempers .
` ` you have to call an ambulance and send it to the farm , '' i said , sounding as reasonable as i could , considering i was in a frenzy .
that seemed right to me , too , so i just hung out at the farm .
every now and then if margaret and luke are talking in this room right overhead i can hear them through the gap around the dryer vent , and i heard that you were at the farm .
while she sat in disbelieving silence , i gave her the bare bones of our trip to corinth , of what had happened at the farm this afternoon .
` ` i ' m at the granberry farm , '' i said .
it 's right next to the old bartell farm , '' i said .
so we bought the farm next to the one where regina was living and set out to make friends with her .
my house is about a mile out of town , on a road that turns into farms pretty much right after it leaves the city limits .
you know , you guys should come to this party tonight , ' she suggested , ' out at the mcnally farm , you know , past the highway ?
' a party out at the mcnally farm , ' he sighs .
on the other side spread rolling hills and farm tracts lying fallow under pristine blankets of snow .
the historians determined that there once was a farm called melkboschkuil , owned by the cloete family , located in the northern cape province of south africa .
` ` that 's the name of the family that once owned melkboschkuil farm .
through the open windows , the night air swept in , carrying the scent of decaying leaves and sour apples and the odor of a dairy farm .
from the next farm down , he could hear cows groaning at the moon , their bells clanging .
silos loomed several miles away and the sweet , rotting scent of a dairy farm was on the breeze .
he 'd earned that shiny red dome working his dairy farm .
pastured cows raised their oblong heads to watch them speed by , and the air that filled the car carried the sweet , rich stink of a dairy farm .
the bodies were recovered from redding 's farm over a three - day excavation period subsequent to his arrest .
i knew it the first day , when i set foot on the farm as an employee , and not as a child , and i saw myself , then looked at my father , and understood that i was no longer here to play and would soon go home to dream about a future setting sail on the high seas .
that night i sat beneath the thatch of our cottage , gazing out over the pastures that rolled away from the farm as the sun went down .
so we moved into an outhouse on my father 's farm .
on the farm caroline helped mother , who at first had been horrified by the idea , saying caroline was too much of a lady to work on the farm .
on the farm caroline helped mother , who at first had been horrified by the idea , saying caroline was too much of a lady to work on the farm .
it was a sadness , perhaps that his dream of running the farm together - fading as it must have been - had finally been dashed for good .
perhaps i never gave enough thought to the effect that all of this might have on caroline 's relationship with my mother and father , but looking back now , it is ludicrous to me to have expected her simply to remain at the farm .
not only was she a help around the farm , but mother had lost a daughter many years ago , so to her caroline was the daughter she never had .
apart from being well - liked and help on the farm , she 'd also been helping my mother and myself with our numbers and letters .
the only person who needs be hurt here tonight is he who took a torch to my father 's farm . ''
or perhaps the farm owner .
i glanced to my left and right , saw only farm buildings , black blocks against the grey night , heard only the occasional bleating of a goat and the sound of insects .
but the assassins did n't burn your father 's farm , did they ?
the time for stealth was over and the genoese soldiers on all sides knew it , abandoning their attempts to storm the farm quietly and rushing up the hill towards the farmyard with a shout .
other rebels were making their escape , and across the yard i saw that genoese soldiers had put torches to farm buildings as well .
i built a home , a farm , a store and a mill .
people who hunted down the others and drove them from their lands , establishing in turn their own farms , villages , and , again at last , towns and cities to rival those of the lost civilization , which had disappeared into the earth many millennia before .
it seemed there were none in jerusalem who wanted what he had : fruits and vegetables from nearby farms .
' plenty of farms on the mainland . '
old macdonald had a farm .
beyond were the bluffs and the tidal marsh and a long valley where a collective farm had sprung up and then failed in the years just after the american revolution .
she told me the only time he was ever happy was at a horse farm near this rental cottage in maine .
he 'd served in vietnam , been honorably discharged , came from a small farm in east texas and had n't had any contact with his family in over six years by the time he was killed .
it was the face of a farm boy or a boy whose mother raised him for the priesthood .
fishing rods and hats and painstakingly detailed model schooners shared space on the walls and the shelves and desktops , and a faded farm table stood behind the couch under what i believe were original paintings by pollock and basquiat and a lithograph by warhol .
the faded farm table , upon second glance , was n't faux rustic , it was truly rustic and french .
he looked back over his shoulder at the fat farm on his porch .
i can talk till i ' m blue about the farm system and the logic - or lack thereof - behind theo 's latest trade , et cetera . ''
` ` they come and said he 'd snuck onto their farm and killed their mule .
the chicago white sox came to town after detroit and ruth went out with a few of them one night , old friends from the farm league days , and they told him that order had been restored to their city , the army finally cheesing it to the niggers and putting them down once and for all .
the trooper gave chase and other staties joined in and they eventually drove the car off the road near a dairy farm in enosburg falls .
` ` i ' ve known her since we were no taller than the dogs on my family farm . ''
` ` he told me he grew up on a farm . ''
` ` migrant farming is when you go from farm to farm with the seasons , depending on the crop . ''
rd pruitt had been klan before he left to do a two - year bid at the state prison farm at raiford , so there was little reason to believe he had n't joined right back up when he got out .
well then you best set to working with me and my boys on the mash and helping us work our farm , till the soil , rotate the crops , milk the cows .
the main house needed almost as much work as the farm .
the farm , under ciggy 's stewardship , continued to work without a hitch .
repairing the house moved more slowly than resurrecting the farm .
chapter twenty - eight how late it was all the boys who worked the farm played baseball , but some were religious about it .
ciggy had heard rumors of a league near these parts , and joe asked him to keep looking into it , particularly for the fall when the farm duties would be at their lightest .
he had already bought a farm with his money , on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life ; but he bestowed the whole on his rival , together with the remains of his prize - money to purchase stock , and then himself solicited the young woman 's father to consent to her marriage with her lover .
about to bet the farm ...
for the last twenty minutes , they 'd traveled alone on this farm road .
` ` that 's fine , '' the old woman yelled to be heard over the engine as they drew near the farm vehicle .
judging by the direction they were moving , it seemed the parkers owned the farm to the right of the enforcer house .
` ` he and a couple of his sons showed up at our farm earlier in the summer . ''
jo blinked in surprise , not at the news that ernie 's father and his brothers had shown up at dee 's farm , but that she actually came from a farm .
jo blinked in surprise , not at the news that ernie 's father and his brothers had shown up at dee 's farm , but that she actually came from a farm .
the father was strung up by his heels from the rafters in the barn the night they stormed the farm .
` ` only she and a younger sister survived to leave the farm .
` ` he has n't left his farm since his last wife died , '' thomas said quietly .
` ` is he still on the farm ? ''
` ` i had some things to do at the farm before i could leave , '' armand said calmly , glancing over the man 's roast beef dinner with disinterest before gazing around the quiet diner .
the farm is only another five - minute drive .
no one but myself and thomas know where the farm is , and this is a rinky - dink little town where no one 's likely to see her . ''
` ` if she 's as bad as all that , how do you plan to convince her to hide out on my farm in the country until you catch this guy ? ''
` ` and she 's agreed to stay on my farm twiddling her thumbs for several weeks ? ''
grimacing , he slipped it from his pocket , flipped it open , and pressed it to his ear , wincing when paul , his manager at the farm , began to squawk in panicked tones about bessy 's labor .
` ` i thought you had a wheat farm ? ''
she was a beautiful woman , and he was looking forward to her company at the farm .
armand 's farm was n't far from the diner , which was probably good since - despite her best efforts - eshe 's mind was preoccupied with her thoughts , leaving her little attention for driving .
` ` they did n't the last time i was on a farm . ''
he 's my day manager here on the farm .
he had shares in argeneau enterprises and ten farms all making a profit .
she 'd then gone through the other barns searching a good - sized one that held horses , and a henhouse full of sleeping chickens that had started stirring before she determined he was n't there and closed the door on the incredible stench coming from inside , and then she 'd checked the last barn to find it held a tractor , a riding lawn mower , and various other farm equipment but no sign of armand .
managing the farm and writing his daily article for the newspaper will wear him out in no time if he does n't . ''
as she waited for the last of the coffee to run through the drip filter , she offered , ` ` that 's when he inherited the farm from his uncle .
he actually owned several farms in southern ontario and rotated his time among them , spending ten years at one and then moving to another before his neighbors noticed that he was n't aging .
each time he moved , the cover story was that he had inherited the farm he took over , but there was no uncle for him to inherit from .
she had no idea what excuse was given to the old farm community to explain his leaving .
i ' m not sure his inheriting the farm was that good for him , really .
he works very hard , rarely leaves the farm , and has no social life to speak of .
i worry he 'll just stay out here and grow old on the farm , never having had the experience of a wife and children . ''
they have a farm not far from here and i gather they 're his sister - in - law and brother - in - law , '' mrs . ramsey confided , and then clucked her tongue .
` ` it was adorable when she was young , but then my ten years at the farm near her father 's ended and i hired on a manager and moved on to one of my others .
` ` anyway , several years later a young immortal woman arrived at my farm in search of a job as maid .
i had a farm to run . ''
it was a busy time at the farm when i was outside more than in .
i understood they were going to their farm , but apparently they made a detour to the city for what was supposed to be a few days , but the first night they were there a fire broke out in the hotel .
he 'd basically withdrawn from their lives and society as a whole , staying on his farms and refusing to see and show that he cared for his children or anyone else in the family for fear that they might suddenly become a target .
while he could n't keep lucian from coming to see him , and had visited with nicholas at first , his visits with his son had always been furtive little stints when he snuck away from the farm to meet with him and get updates on thomas and jeanne louise and the rest of the family .
armand had no doubt that mrs . ramsey had probably been on the phone all morning telling everyone she knew that he had female company on the farm , and that was before she 'd even seen eshe .
armand frowned and then admitted , ` ` she spent a lot of time away from the farm after jeanne louise was born .
i was busy on the farm and we still had to hunt to feed , and i just assumed that was what she was doing , but after she died ... '' ` ` after she died ... ? ''
they were halfway through the meal when she finally asked , ` ` so is there anyone else i should know about who comes to the farm besides mrs .
` ` but it seemed unfair to agnes to just thrust my son on her , especially when they made it plain they did n't plan to move back in with me but were going to buy their own little farm in the next town over .
he 's been slowly buying up farms like i did .
` ` will you have to start buying farms further away ? ''
she was so wound up with anticipation that the moment the truck stopped in front of the farm , eshe was springing out the door and hurrying for the house .
'cause that sure as hell is n't farm wear . ''
looking her over , he asked , ` ` so is this the latest fashion in farm wear now ?
he was at court when his life mate susanna died in a stable fire at their home , and he was home on the farm when his second wife , althea , died in a fire in the hotel she and her parents were staying in , in toronto .
` ` he was on the farm when they died too , but while i suppose that means he could have killed them , he could n't have killed the first two women , so if they 're connected he 's in the clear . ''
` ` right , because he was at court when susanna died and here on the farm when althea died in a hotel fire in toronto , '' bricker reasoned .
bricker nodded repeatedly and then asked , ` ` and we know he was at court and then on the farm and nowhere near toronto because ... ? ''
or maybe he had a visitor at the farm who could prove he was there and not in toronto at the time of the fire ? ''
` ` my uncle had a farm and i used to go there , but i never quite figured out the attraction of treading through manure . ''
if he 'd never been on a farm before , he would n't know what the hell he was doing .
` ` armand says he was away at court when susanna died in a stable fire , and that he was home on the farm when althea died in the hotel fire in toronto .
some had pegged him as her lover and suspected a love triangle had developed at the farm .
in truth , it looked brand - spanking - new and was obviously the latest of the six farms armand had mentioned john accumulating .
william and mary harcourt lived in a home not dissimilar to the maunsell farm .
` ` because we 'd barely left the farm when the women started talking about perhaps making the trip to toronto while althea was staying with us , '' he said , and then explained , ` ` armand was on another farm at that time as were we .
` ` because we 'd barely left the farm when the women started talking about perhaps making the trip to toronto while althea was staying with us , '' he said , and then explained , ` ` armand was on another farm at that time as were we .
his farm was at that time northeast of london , about halfway between our farm and toronto .
his farm was at that time northeast of london , about halfway between our farm and toronto .
armand was good enough to put mary and me up at the farm until we bought a place of our own .
they drove past john and agnes maunsell 's place on the way back to the farm , but while it was full dark out now , there were no lights on in the house and both the car and van were gone .
` ` race you back to the farm . ''
it seemed one of his neighbors had a grown son who had studied agriculture at the university and planned to someday take over the family farm or start his own concern .
his father was still in his early forties , however , and young enough to run the farm without his son 's aid , and - no doubt - still thought of the young man as a boy and treated him as such .
it was thought all around that what would be best for the boy was if he helped out armand , managing his farm for him .
it would put some more experience under the boy 's belt , and prepare him for when he was ready to either take over the family farm , or stake a claim on another one for himself .
he had a farm to look after and she had a job to do , saving his son from execution for something he might not have done .
` ` not gon na happen , '' bricker announced , and when she turned a questioning eye his way , explained , ` ` i went past the maunsells ' farm last night and then again tonight .
` ` he 's running one of my farms .
` ` all my farms were here ... i did consider it , though , so rosamund could be closer to her family and jeanne louise could have grandparents , but then rosamund died . ''
no doubt he then would have bought a new farm and kept the address to himself so you could n't find him again .
` ` yes , but you were also at the farm when they left , '' lucian pointed out .
` ` anything we can , '' eshe said dryly , glancing out the passenger side window of the suv as they turned onto the road the maunsell farm was on .
` ` if they 're in , '' bricker commented dryly , and then a moment later as the dark farm came into view , added , ` ` which it does n't appear like they are .
when she winced , he smiled faintly and said , ` ` i ' m afraid your presence and name have been making the rounds on the tongue of every gossip between here and armand 's farm . ''
` ` are you headed back to the farm ? ''
we 're heading back to the farm . ''
` ` i just want to be sure he and anders did head home when they found cedrick was n't there and are n't sitting out at the farm he runs waiting for him . ''
she 'd explained that they 'd run into him at the maunsell farm and were bringing him back to armand 's farm to speak with him .
she 'd explained that they 'd run into him at the maunsell farm and were bringing him back to armand 's farm to speak with him .
eshe had barely finished talking to him and ended the call before bricker was pulling into the driveway at armand 's farm .
` ` and when althea died you were at the farm helping armand ? ''
` ` i was around in the area , but i was at the farm i was managing at the time .
eshe glanced his way to see that he was alone and supposed cedrick had headed back to the farm he was running .
tonight was not like the other nights when eshe had visited this farm .
` ` it seemed kinder than leaving them alone at the farm to fend for themselves .
` ` while he was out working so hard tilling the soil , she would ride into london and pick up a man and then either go to his place or even sometimes bring him back to the farm and have sex with him .
` ` i have other farms , '' armand said , ushering eshe toward his pickup .
once they got to the farm cedrick was managing , armand made her and the boys wait in the vehicles to avoid standing out in the sun while he went and rousted cedrick from his bed .
he had to go check on one of the other farms or something , '' anders said with a shrug .
she had n't seen any cows at the maunsell farm .
his gaze slid over the farm john had led him to .
it was quite a distance from the farm where john and agnes presently lived , and it would have been less of a drive for armand had john just told armand to meet him there and given armand the address .
instead , john had waited for armand at the main farm and then led him there in his van .
` ` i imagine john 's visiting one of the other farms but i have no idea where armand is .
perhaps it 's at one of the other farms , '' eshe suggested , but her heart was sinking again as agnes shook her head .
the farms are all jointly owned .
` ` we have n't purchased a cow , but did buy a new farm a couple months ago .
should we buy a farm near armand , or farther away to avoid althea ?
i killed her on the spot , then loaded her in the wagon and drove to a point about halfway between your farm and town and tried to make it look an accident .
she grimaced , laughed , and said , ` ` well , except for the part about being determined that i should find a nice canadian farm boy to ' play with ' while here . ''
` ` i ' m surprised you live on a farm , '' valerie said quietly as she reached the fence and leaned against it next to him .
he had a farm .
hurting , i staggered around the counter to the big farm table shoved against the interior wall , all but falling into my hard - backed chair and nearly knocking an express mail box onto the floor .
they were everywhere , surrounding every settlement , from tiny farms to entire cities .
the people 'd sent for her and she 'd looked at him and seen the guilt writhing in his head like a red worm , and then she 'd taken them to his farm and showed them where to dig , and he 'd thrown himself down and asked her for mercy , because he said he 'd been drunk and it 'd all been done in alcohol .
' and i think we left the bag with the toy farm .
when we approached the buildings that stored the farm equipment , some motorcycles , four wheelers , and a couple of jeeps with oversized tires , i noticed jack screwing a cap back on one of the bikes .
to us , it signaled the end of a long day on our farm . ''
` ` one of our greatest hopes was to fill that farm with a handful of boisterous children . ''
her expression took on a longing wistfulness , and i remembered her story from the other night ... about wanting to fill a farm with children .
but also , the normalcy of working hard on their farm during the day and watching the sun set every night , the potential to fill that farm with children .
but also , the normalcy of working hard on their farm during the day and watching the sun set every night , the potential to fill that farm with children .
slapping on a farm boy smile , jack stepped forward to open the door .
we 'd done all the touristy stuff people do in l.a . - disneyland , knott 's berry farm , universal studios , la brea tar pits , counted the stars of the walk of fame .
we 'd been thrown into the cellar of an old farm house .
` ` and working on a farm is n't ? ''
they showed up on mr . bateman 's farm . ''
` ` yes , i ' m all about spending my evenings running around on a farm with a board and rope . ''
it only took a few minutes for alexander to get ready , and then he drove us over to mr . bateman 's farm .
the batemans ' farm was close to becky 's .
passing motorists stared at us as we drove from the factory through the winding roads that led to the batemans ' farm .
i asked as several visiting cars from the farm headed home .
one by one the cars left the farm and eventually the batemans ' house lights went dark .
far below , despite the gathering dusk , she could see castles , farms , and churches in the valley .
lights in the distance heralded farms and for a moment she thought to stop at one of the nearest ones for aid , but terry had been bitten by a mage - bred snake carrying vampire blood .
numerous small farms were scattered across the green , rolling hills .
they had traveled far past the perimeters of the village and well out into the rolling hills where farms dotted the landscape .
she strode with tremendous confidence , weaving in and out of the hay sheaves until she was clear of the farms .
she was much more careful , taking her burden through more open ground cautiously as she approached the farms .
he flew over the rolling hills dotted with a half dozen farms .
sheep dotted the meadows and farms and churches and castles stretched out below them .
let 's say we take a nice ride to the funny farm .
trees had long since overtaken the spot where the land had been cleared to make way for a small village and farm .
just below the mountain near the small farm tucked into the shadow .
as they approached the small farm , the air lost its crisp , fresh scent and began to feel and smell foul .
she has armed herself with garlic , crosses and holy water , but has no real weapon other than farm tools .
ivory turned back , circling the farm once to make certain there was no feel of danger before she dropped down into the remains of what once had been a snug house .
you must have come along and interrupted him before he could do too much damage to the farm . ''
ivory dipped her wings and circled away from the ravaged wasteland below , taking them through a narrow pass and then over rolling hills dotted with small farms , but she felt his smile .
he has a private clinic and treatment facility on an old farm property in sherborn , southwest of boston . ''
dr . lewis 's private clinic was nestled on a pastoral stretch of land that had once been a colonial farm in the rural town of sherborn .
then , doubtfully , ` ` but we 're going to burdock farm .
we 're going to live at burdock farm . ''
jade said , aw , rowan ... ` ` that'senough.tell him not to remember anything about this - and find out if he knows where burdock farm is . ''
` ` the farm 's back that way - we have to go back tothe fork in the road , '' she said .
` ` at burdock farm .
's house was on.it was only two miles from burdock farm to chiloquin .
by the time they got to burdock farm , it was full dark .
it would be a good night , and she could keep an eye out for stragglers from the perseid meteor storm as she walked to burdock farm .
they were sitting on oversize , overstuffed victorian furniture in the living room at burdock farm .
the sisters and ash were waiting at burdock farm .
mr . kimble had a farm east of town .
they got back to burdock farm .
the big farm kitchen was warm and bright , but the windowswere darkening .
despite the gusher that had been discovered on his property a few months after the busey number one had come in near el dorado , thomas refused to move to more comfortable accommodations in town , preferring instead to remain on the family farm he 'd inherited from his father nearly half a century earlier .
his nearest neighbor was nearly two miles away and he did sometimes get lonely , but the farm made him feel closer to his wife , mary , who had passed away five years ago .
` ` but it 's an old farm , not a mansion .
i said , ` ` i think instead of calling this the stackhouse place , i 'll just call it the body farm . ''
the largest ley line on the east coast runs through a farm outside of woodstock .
i hale from a farm .
` ` sara jane 's younger sister wants off the farm to become a witch , '' he said .
` ` if you would , find the asking price on sara jane 's home farm .
just what i 'd expect a farm girl would wear on her first day on the job .
obviously she guessed trent might be buying the farm her family was serfed upon .
it said that the carrier was either a ) stupid and about to buy the farm or b ) they were good enough to get those blades into anything they came up against .
` ` said you lot would have bought the farm if she had n't turned up . ''
but her younger brothers were exploring the farm , her older ones were away at eton , her sisters were busy with fripperies or marriages - possibly one and the same - and the mechanicals were trundling about their daily tasks .
her old chum roger the stable lad stood and waved at her from the farm 's pony and cart .
pillover joined them , as confident in his new situation as if he had always expected to set off with his sister and two other girls in a farm cart .
a heavy , antique farm table took up the interior wall , my end holding a stack of books that had n't been there earlier .
the last two books slid into place , and i straightened , wiping my hands on my jeans while i looked at them sitting oh so nicely between the country farm 's cookie cookbook i 'd swiped from my mom and the copy of real witches eat quiche i had gotten from the i.s .
the paint ball gun shop had been the hardest to find , being ` ` left where the old post office used to be , past the baptist church that burned down in ' seventy - five , and right at the higgan 's farm turnaround .
nick went ashen when he unearthed a maggot farm under it , and gagging , i kicked leaves to cover them .
i was hoping that if i was grumpy enough everyone else would go to the beach and leave me behind because i had a plan -- i wanted to sneak off to the mushroom farm .
but if i could n't go to the mushroom farm , i knew someone who could .
one of their descen- dants , old morris , still lives there , although the castle has almost disappeared , and now it is the mushroom farm .

she fully expected dinah to say rosewood public , or maybe one of the alternative quaker schools where everyone was forced to work on the campus farm .
carols hummed from the stereo speakers , a fire blazed in the fireplace , and the piney scent of the douglas fir they 'd bought at the local tree farm filled the air .
when a sign for a christmas tree farm swept past , she considered asking byron if they could chop one down .
as several more trotted to the edge of the fence , batting their enviably long eyelashes , aria smiled and exhaled , figuring the farm must have a whole herd of them .
to get there , emily had to drive through the parking lot of a kinko 's , a yarn store , and the amish market , which sold homemade apple butter and paintings of farm animals on lacquered slabs of wood .
they entered a subdivision called darrow farms .
it looked like it had once been a real farm , with rolling green hills and lots of fields for crops and livestock , but a developer had subdivided it into identical plots of enormous homes .
the wind shifted , smelling pungently of cow manure from a nearby farm .
` ` yeah , this place used to be a farm back in the day .
the sign for darrow farms loomed ahead .
melissa turned out of their neighborhood , and they drove in silence for a few minutes , sweeping past johnson farm , which sold organic butter and veggies , and then the big township park .
it was a hilly , picturesque lane that featured a series of dairy farms , a crumbling stone wall from the revolutionary war , and a mansion so huge and sprawling that it had three separate garages and its own helipad .

` ` you live on a farm ? ''
chapter 52 portraits picture this : a farm in west texas .
the sounds of my brother 's laughter carrying back to my young , happy ears as we ran through the fields of purple and gold , racing over the farm to the brook that ran behind our land .
i hated those moments , having to wave to the villagers like i was royalty , when in truth i was a farm girl just like many of the sabithians .
we shared stories of farm life , how similar the people in vasterya seemed to those in sabithia .
in the distance we saw cows and sheep in neighbouring farm lands .
but as the city disappeared behind us and the land grew quieter , passing many farms off the beaten track , my body grew happy for the peace , and thus began to give in to its need for respite .
` ` we ' ve stopped at a nearby farm .
dozens of tents scattered the farm ; dogs , cats running around , horses grazing leisurely , some sheep and cattle off in the distance .
i ' m a farm girl . ''
as we galloped down the muddy trade road , past farm country , wolfe slowed a little until my horse was abreast his .
i felt the pull of the little farm over the border into daeronia .
it would take another half day or so to ride onto caera , so i took us off the main trade road and into the fields towards a tiny farm owned by an elderly widow my magic told me would help us .
she nodded , leading us past her little sitting room and into a larger farm kitchen .
he was a vikomt and i was a farm girl !
i did n't see much from the trade roads , only a farm or two visible from the road , but i was n't interested .
when i lived on the farm i could run for miles without stopping ; i could climb trees like a trapeze artist ; walk and climb and walk some more and never want to stop .
i did n't know what i had expected the resistance to look like , but a quiet farm , surrounded by all the beauty nebraska had to offer , was not it .
field , farm , field , farm , lake , field , farm , mountain ... . austria was breathtaking .
field , farm , field , farm , lake , field , farm , mountain ... . austria was breathtaking .
field , farm , field , farm , lake , field , farm , mountain ... . austria was breathtaking .
in the middle of nebraska cornfields , on a classic midwestern farm , and on a cliche hay bale located in the back of a tractor barn perpendicular to a field of horses ; i watched my fellow immortals , magic coursing through our blood in unison , and felt completely out of place .
the way that amory phrased the question left me positive he was not only referring to my presence at the club , but my behavior over the course of the entire evening ; starting with my quick getaway off of the farm .
when he returned to the farm , he was weak but already he had reclaimed most of his magic .
` ` do you want to go to the farm tonight ? ''
that way i would n't be so overwhelmed by everyone at the farm , and things would still get done without my stubborn refusal to participate .
i appreciated the warm words and pleasantries , especially since during my last visit to the farm i had felt sorely out of place .
really , i felt out of place , not just on the farm , but in the entire immortal world .
i did n't fit in on the farm .
we drove through winding , pot - hole stricken roads , passing small farms with nothing more than shanty 's for dwelling places and starving children waving us by .
when we got to the farm all of the other teams had been assembled , including a ton of older generation immortals and we were given the history of you and avalon and told that once we got you involved , we would be unstoppable , '' he winked at me , and because of his over - dramatic tone i hoped he was joking .
still , avalon and jericho 's faces flashed before me and i could n't drown the sick feeling that they and everyone on the farm would be in danger .
he owned every kind of electronic anything back at the farm , but he had left them all for the visitors staying there .
` ` my tux is still at the cleaners , i 'll have to run back to the farm . ''
` ` hey , jer , can i go back to the farm with you ? ''
i offered , not liking the idea of jericho and roxie riding to the farm together .
i looked around for signs of jericho or avalon , but remembered they had gone to the farm to work with some younger recruits who had just arrived .
` ` do you mind if we go to the farm , too ?
he was at the farm , surrounded by titans .
i had to get to the farm .
the farm was surrounded by the brutal guard , and the more titans i destroyed , the more seemed to pop up , greedily taking the lives of the innocent .
the blizzard intensified , the snow blinding visibility and the wind whipping violently through the open fields of the farm land .
i watched as the car drove away , through the blood soaked snow , off the farm and out of my life .
i broke down , tears of rage and heartbreak poured out of my eyes and i fell to my knees , left alone in the wreckage of the farm .
the farm was eerily quiet , covered in fresh snow and not occupied by a single soul other than myself .
but man , when we heard what happened at the farm , that our worst nightmare came true , well , we just ... . it was hard to stay here .
what happened at the farm ?
before the tragic night at the farm , amory trusted our secret with those that shared the mark of the resistance .
they destroyed my farm .
his one shoulder still sagged , like it had the night he was taken from the farm and his clothes were soaked with dried blood .
` ` the farm is flattened , but there is enough room at amory 's for everyone to stay .
we were back at the old farm .
birds chirped , the leftovers of angelica 's garden bloomed and the farmers on neighboring farms worked hard to prepare the land for planting .
the devastated farm stood as a constant reminder of what we were working for and motivated the teams to work as hard as possible .
sebastian asked quietly , staring out across the farm at caden halstead and his team working through combat training .
the moon , a perfect orb of illumination tonight , at its fullest and brightest , shined down on the broken farm .
they were sitting together on some of the gathered debris picked up from around the farm .
i had n't drained someone so quickly since the night at the farm , and i was happy to know i still had it in me , at least for a little bit longer .
each time i saw him again ever since he was first taken from the farm , was a miracle .
you left me on that farm , in the wake of your destruction , alone !
i burst through the brass doors and fell into a wall of titan guards that surrounded ronan hannigan , the irish immortal who had been sentenced to death first when he was part of avalon 's team that attacked kiran on our camping trip last october and second after he was rounded up with the group of immortals taken from the farm .
and then again at the farm , it was my failure to stop the titans from taking him and everyone else .
since the night on the farm when my grandfather died , not one person asked me what i did with his body .
through the picture window i could see three cars speed down the long gravel drive that led to the farm .
kiran , still reluctant to let me go sighed when i lifted my head to look around the quiet farm .
the mystery behind the onyx necklace around my neck had been nagging me since the latvian farm and i needed answers .
and the way he gave me his magic on the farm , the way he just handed it over , after thousands of years of not dying .
i mean , there were things that obviously sent up red flags in our past , like when he planned to testify against me at my trial , and when he attacked the farm ... .
i love you , i know you love me , i just , i ' ve moved on , i ' ve forgiven you for the farm that night , for all the bitterness i selfishly held against you .
` ` there is a big difference between the livestock farms from your country and hunting in order to feed a village of hungry children , '' she replied snidely .
` ` if i remember correctly , there were four other men with terletov from that latvian farm ? ''
` ` terletov 's farm is deserted .
` ` nothing like that here , this farm was a dead end , '' gabriel answered honestly .
i glanced around the deserted farm anxiously , hoping that bringing everyone back to terletov 's latvian estate would bring us some answers .
however , eden was n't debriefed until much later , after terletov had been moved to the prison and this farm cleaned up .
old farm equipment hung on rusted hooks protruding from the walls and short , stools and benches littered the hay covered earthen ground .
we had returned to the farm , another place that had been destroyed by battle .
but also because we had moved to the farm until we could get out of omaha and back to the citadel .
until i could move our party we stayed at the farm where i felt the safest .
i turned from the staircase that led up from the kitchen , an old servant 's hall from back when this farm had things like ... . servants .
my dad had been letting me drive since i was big enough to reach the pedals and see over the steering wheel , and on tristan 's farm i had grown up driving his dad 's tractors or racing tristan and his brothers on four - wheelers .
i had come right out and told him everything about my origins , my destiny on this planet and my future role in saving earth from the legions of darkness one day when we were climbing hay bales on his family 's farm .

when it finally did come , i was back at lincoln 's farm , fighting my first battle with the shadows .
` ` when we fought at lincoln 's farm ? ''
it was very early , not even light yet , but my parents , jupiter , seth and i had all congregated around boxes of cereal and fresh milk bought from a farm down the road , to discuss last night 's african battle and my lingering bad feelings .
` ` do you two need a ride back to that sweet little farm town ? ''
if we did n't go after aliah , he would be back for us , although since we killed seven of his entourage i was hoping he would reconsider his effort at least outside of my small little farm town .

on the fifth night , when we stopped to make camp at an abandoned farm , i wanted to leap from my horse in joy .
inside the farm 's broken - down barn , the darkling 's men had cleared a space on the earthen floor and built a fire .
i spent that night sleeping in the tidy hayloft of a dairy farm just off the vy .
from then on , i kept to the woods and fields , using hunters ' trails and farm tracks .
i had always been a rotten hunter , so i subsisted on the meager supplies i 'd bought back in balakirev , on water from streams , and the occasional egg or apple stolen from a lonely farm .

the phone book was downstairs , but i knew the number to call directory enquiries , and i only had to ask for anybody named hempstock living at hempstock farm .
i waited for the operator to come on the line , and tell me the number of the hempstocks ' farm .
i wished that my parents would send ursula monkton away , and then i would go down to the hempstocks ' farm , and tell lettie what i had done , and she would forgive me , and make everything all right .
soon enough - in a few days at the most - someone will take me into town , or away from here , and then i will go to the farm at the bottom of the lane , and i will tell lettie hempstock what i did .
i hoped i was still heading for the hempstocks ' farm .
i knew only that the hempstocks ' farm was at the end of my lane , but i was lost in a dark field , and the thunderclouds had lowered , and the night was so dark , and it was still raining , even if it was not raining hard yet , and now my imagination filled the darkness with wolves and ghosts .
i would have been at the hempstocks ' farm by now .
i saw the lights of the hempstocks ' farm in front of us , welcoming , and i was cheered , although i could not understand how we had got from the field we were in to the farmhouse so quickly .

thankfully , no one had questioned yrene 's small presence ; and in those long years , no one looked her way as she helped the family farm struggle to return to normal in the wake of adarlan 's forces .

joe had worked on a farm with his parents until their death , and then worked on a large farm to save enough money to buy his own piece of land .
he immediately began looking for work , and found a large farm that paid good wages .
the land seemed like it would make a good farm .
last year had been the first time that the farm had actually shown a profit .
until now , every penny that the farm made had to be put right back into it to help it grow .
joe hoped his farm would continue to make money in the years to come , especially since he had a wife and child to care for .
someday we will have little ones to share our love with on this little farm .
for the next two years the couple worked the land and began their dream of making it into a good farm .

when the weather permitted the two also enjoyed going to the creek that ran through the richards farm and doing some fishing .
sometimes they would fish on the ashers farm , but they seemed to catch more on the richards land .
during the spring and summer , hunting had to take a back burner to the farm work .
he knew he did nt want to spend his life on the farm , but still had no idea what he wanted to do .
there were always things around the farm that were broken or in need of repair , so hardware was the first stop joe always made in the general store .
after he had finished buying the things needed for the farm , and picking up some supplies , he told tom to wait in the wagon while he talked to some of the men about the rumors he had been hearing .
i get a lot of practice out at the farm .
tom and his pa rode silently on the way back to the farm .
during the winter months debris seemed to find its way onto the farm .
there was no mention of the situation that evening , or for the next several days around the richards farm .
he knew his pa was concerned about the impact all of this would have on not only his farm , but those around him .
there was no doubt he was big enough and strong enough to handle the work , but he was nt sure he had enough knowledge to run the farm the way it should be run .
growing up on the farm had one advantage for young tom , he was growing stronger by the day .
he was confident he would be able to handle the work around the farm if needed , but that did nt mean he wanted to have to do it alone .
his pa was not the fretting type , unless it was something really important that would have an effect on his family or farm .
for the first five years he had lived on the farm , all the work had fell upon his shoulders .
maybe there would be some news that would help ease the tension around the farm .
he knew the farm needed attention from sunup until sundown .
it seems unfair to leave becky and tom here alone to run the farm .
there was always something to do around the farm .
he felt confident that tom could take care of the farm until he returned , but there was always a chance he would never see the farm again .

you ll take care of the farm until i get back .
tom was trying to imagine what life on the farm was going to be like without his pa . joe was thinking about having to leave his family in two weeks .
i have no doubt you can run this farm until i get back .
i guess there will be a shortage of men on all the farms around here .
he could nt imagine what the war would be like , or what it would be like having to run the farm without his pa .
he wanted to spend as much time with his pa as he could , and also ask as many questions as he could think of about what he needed to do around the farm .
joe had been extremely busy trying to get everything caught up around the farm so his son would nt have to worry about it for a while .
i know you do nt think you are ready to handle the farm tom , but trust me , you ll do fine .
deep down he knew he could handle the farm well enough .
he had to have faith that his lord would watch over him and bring him back safely to the farm .
he knew there would be a lot of praying going on around the richards farm , and probably all over the north and south .
the two got up on the wagon and headed for the ashers farm .
a few times they had camped close to the house on the richards farm , but this was much different .
his pa had thought these would be skills he would need not only on the farm , but when he was hunting .
it was difficult to grow up on a farm without developing a taste for the brew .
it would also be up to them to protect their farms and homes .
then ill have to get the farm ready for the winter .
they would have to take the place of their fathers on the farms , and that was a tall order for both of them .
tom imagined that farms all over the area would be doing the same type of adjusting .
he again thought about poor mason having to not only run a farm , but a grist mill to boot .
he was worried about taking care of the farm without his pa to help .
if he could nt handle it the farm would fall apart , and he knew his pa was counting on him .
over the next few weeks tom and becky tried to work out a schedule that would allow them to get all the things done that needed taken care of on the farm .
he was hoping the farm would yield a good crop for them this year .
how s the farm treating you ?
i reckon about every farm in the area lost someone to the war .
i know your pa will be proud of the way you have handled the farm when he gets back .
all that farm works putting muscles on you for sure .
no , he wants me to take over the farm someday , and i do nt want to let him down .
i hope everything is going well on the farm .
i must tell you , i thought farm life was hard , but it is nothing compared to this living .
everything around the farm was different without him .
he had spent about an hour walking around the farm looking at things when becky called for him to come and eat .
at first i did nt understand why you wanted me to check everything around the farm .
we ve got a good house , a fine farm , and the best food in the country .
not only was he worried about his pa , but not working the farm that day had left him with a lot of energy he did nt usually have by bedtime .
the days passed slowly on the farm for the next several weeks .
the farm had turned out a good crop , and had put a little money in the richards savings .
he would be proud to know that his son had done so well with the farm .
he worked hard on the farm , and it was only right that he reap some of the benefits .
the farm had been making money for several years now , but most of it went for upkeep and everyday expenses .
there was still a lot of work to do on the farm during the winter months , but he did nt mind that as much as actually working the fields .
by the first week of october tom had finished with repairs around the farm that needed to be done before the really cold weather set in .
he saddled up one of the horses and rode over to the ashers farm .
tom went through all the stuff he had done on the farm since he last saw his friend .
i never thought about what the farm would be like without pa , and then all of the sudden he was gone .
everything was caught up around the farm , so he could spend the whole day hunting if he wanted .
nothing went to waste on the farm .
he knew the woods on the farm like the back of his hand .
there were also plenty of woods between the richards farm and the ashers farm , which he hunted to a small degree .
there were also plenty of woods between the richards farm and the ashers farm , which he hunted to a small degree .
there was always something that needed doing around the farm .
repairs had been made around the farm , at least those that needed doing .

along with the money that had been made from selling the crops , this was one of the best years since joe had started the farm .
there were a few things that were needed on the farm , and he purchased all that was on the list .
running the farm without pa is hard .
i m glad to know how well things are going on the farm .
with the way things are going on the farm , and my savings , we should be in pretty good shape money wise when i get home .
finally , they decided to talk about the farm .
all of his life his pa had just assumed he would take over the farm someday and carry on the family tradition .
for the time being the farm was doing well , but all it would take to turn that around was a dry season .
by the first of april tom was behind a plow and turning the ground on the richards farm .
if there was one thing that could be said for farm work , it made you appreciate a good place to lie down at the end of the day .
now tom would have time to tend to some repairs that were needed around the farm .
the creek running through the farm was full of catfish , and he loved the way his ma could fry them up .
i do nt know much about cattle , and i would be pretty much lost on a farm .
* * * * chapter 13 the summer of 1862 was very kind to the richards farm .
tom had more than learned enough in the last several years to make a go of farm life if he so chose .
she had grown to really respect him for the way he had stepped up and took his pas place on the farm .
it stood to reason that a lot of farms had to be let go while the men were away fighting .
hopefully he would break a record this year for money made off the farm .
even though life on the farm was hard , there were things that could make it a little more bearable .
his ma always made a list of the things she needed on the farm .
even though sometimes his pas letters skipped a month , it still caused worry on the farm .
he could swing by the ashers farm and drop off the meat .
the farm was only a few hundred yards off his path anyway .
after stopping by the ashers farm and dropping off his load of meat he and mason sat on the porch for a spell and talked .
hunting has been very good this season , so there has been plenty of meat , and the farm produced the biggest crops we have ever had .
how s things going out on the farm .
just look at what you ve done with that farm .
he wanted to get back to the ashers farm as soon as he could now .
that s cause you re always laying around over at the farm .
there s one thing about farm living , you do nt have much time for laziness .

by the time he was ready to make his trip into town he had two deer to drop off at the asher farm .
tom dropped the deer off at the ashers farm on the way into town .
nothing seems the same around the farm with pa not there .
not only did it provide the family with bacon , ham , lard , and many other pieces of meat , it also meant the farm hogs were safe for another season .
there was a hog farm on the other side of cranston where the richards always bought their baby pigs .
living and working on a farm it was nt hard to fall asleep if you had a chance .
there were a few things that were running low on the farm , and he had to go purchase them .
you ve done a fine job with that farm tom .
i m sure they will , but i plan to still help out around the farm .
the rest of the month seemed to drag by on the farm .
his confidence in running the farm had grown to the point he did nt worry as much about that anymore .
he was sure word had spread around cranston that their farm was doing well , and someone might think it would be easy to take what money they had from them .
since the only people that ever came to the richards farm were the ashers and beckys parents , that was highly unlikely .
you just do nt know how empty this farm has felt without you .
i hear tell you ve done quite a job with the farm son .
i have been amazed at how well he has done with the farm .
all i could think about was i would never see my family or my farm again .
* * * * chapter 17 things slowly began getting back to normal around the richards farm .
his ma had depended on him to run the farm for the past two years , and now he was back to just being a boy working for his family .
there was no doubt he could still carry his weight around the farm .
he had done most everything around the farm for the last two years , and it was different not having to do it himself .
so many homes and farms had been destroyed , and so many men were spending their time fighting instead of raising crops and herds .
besides , the farm was turning some of the highest profits it had ever seen , and the family made enough from that to get by on .
you are about to become a man , and the farm is making better money now , so i thought you should have something special to start your transition into manhood .
meat seemed to be in short supply in the area due to a loss of homes and farms being damaged during the war .
i know you and ma have always planned on me taking over the farm someday , but i m not sure that is what i want to do for the rest of my life .
he said if i found i did nt like it i could always quit and come back to the farm .
i was hoping you would take over the farm one day , but i understand that a man has to do what he thinks will make him happy .
if things do nt work out this old farm will always be waiting .
he had always thought his son would take over the farm , and be safe and sound .
he would nt be able to use the horses from the farm because his pa would need them for work .
after the crops were planted joe and tom made a trip to the smiths farm on the other side of cranston .
the sheriff had him coming in at three in the afternoon , so he still had plenty of time to help around the farm in the mornings .
why leave a perfectly safe farm to be a lawman ?
he d begun , polly , caleb and samuel are old enough to take care of the farm for a few weeks .
but i do not think it meet to stand idly by while my sons can manage the farm , and my service is needed .

dillon was the stepson of a farm family living in the upstate new york , county of ontario which is located midway between the cities of rochester and syracuse .
he was about five and a half feet tall , weighed about a hundred and sixty pounds and was solid and muscular due to his life of farm work .
he was generally dressed in typical farm clothes but dressed in a modern style suit when he went into town .
stanley and mabel chapman owned a hundred acres of prime farm land and got by quite well although they were not wealthy .
she was a tough farm wife and accustomed to hard work .
dillon was a good farm worker even with his twisted leg .
he was especially fond of horses , dogs and various farm animals .
he got around pretty good and could do most kinds of farm work even with a twisted leg .
he had a dog that followed him everywhere he went on the farm .
most of his time was spent helping out on the farm .
the following saturday dillon rode his horse to town to visit with some of his buddies and practice with the band and buy some things for the farm at the general store .
it would , however , offer a welcome break in the monotony of farm life .
following a long draw on the pipe he blew a smoke ring and said dillon , you ve been a big help to us here on the farm ; the nearest thing to a son that i ever had , and i d like to do something for you .
he was a hired man here on the farm ; but for now i want you to know that i ve got some savings at the bank down town and i d like to make you a loan .

upon arriving at the farm the three visitors entered the kitchen dillon never knocked unless the door was locked- and they found mabel and stanley at the table drinking coffee .
dillon was suddenly on his feet , there s an old vacant house about two miles from the chapman farm that used to belong to a hired man .

just as he was about to depart again for the hill farm , tanaquil sent him an invitation .
he intended to ignore it ; but then he thought he could put off the meeting with the farm manager for a couple of days - he had n't been needed to start the harvest , after all , it was the processing of the olives and the accounting for the yield he was needed for - and since he 'd be away for a few weeks , it would be good to see tanaquil before he went .

still , there had been enough left for rasce to buy a small farm here , where servius had set aside the land for etruscan settlers , on the hill formerly called oakhill , where the oaks still sheltered herds of stocky black pigs , which rooted for acorns among the roots .
and so we see the values of farms , of properties , what people are importing and how they pay for it . ''
there 's always work on a farm . ''
there was nothing could be said to that argument , so servius changed the subject , encouraging the men to imagine how the walls would look to an approaching enemy , how the northern celts for instance , or the southern greeks , might have cast envious eyes on the growing wealth of the city , but this would deter them ; but he knew , all the time , the men had only half a mind on what he was saying , but were still thinking about their farms , their businesses , the way rome had stolen their time and given them only mud and backache to show for it .
and how instead of doing what everybody expected , and sending his men to fight , he gave them seed and ploughshares and oxen , and dispersed them among the fields and pastures , where they settled , and married local women , and brought up children and horses and their long - legged , long - horned white cattle ; and though cranu did n't live to see it , by his son 's day every single farm in the valley was in etruscan hands . ''
he owns more farms than anybody else , all along the fjord , and he likes to check each of them regularly , to get some dirt on his hands and keep his local managers honest .

this physical problem , she realized suddenly , staring at the old farm with wide , bloodshot eyes , had probably saved her life .

chapter twenty - seven what started out as a quiet , normal ( to the extent a struggling farm town populated with characters right out of a dickens or twain novel can be described using the adjective normal ) wednesday , soon turned into something else entirely , at least for the mayor and myself .
they were masters of segue , moving adroitly between train wrecks , girl scout cookie drives , and slick politicians who swore on their mothers graves they had no foreknowledge that the bundles of cash crammed into briefcases of trusted bag men and women were for backroom support for the latest , small business destroying , big box store developments to be built on prime farm ground on the edge of town secured via imminent domain .

i guess , said louie recognizing that it was a case of dealing with one thing at a time , the immediate problem to deal with is the pollution of the stream by the proposed dairy farm .
over the next two days , saturday and sunday , louie and lulu flew to the dairy farm to check what was happening .
during the week that followed , louie and lulu flew to the farm on a daily basis and observed the situation as they had promised pearl .
with the visits to the farm on friday , saturday and sunday , louie and lulu saw the shufflegrub sons training the cows to find the milking shed and use the automated milking equipment .
of course the cows may have come from a farm with a similar setup and it was just a case of the cows knowing where the milking shed was .
they then flew off to see what was happening at the shufflegrub dairy farm .
louie and lulu reported on todays findings at the farm .
there would no doubt be some transactions in the councils account showing disappearance of funds into a certain dairy farm , probably under the name of appleton estate expenses .
it depends on what we find with the council bank account , what happens at the farm and how soon the councillors return from their little holiday .
if we do start at the bank tomorrow , the return of the councillors will probably coincide with the time things start happening at the farm .
lulu and i will go up to the farm first to see what is going on then meet you back at the tunnel .
the next day ( tuesday ) louie and lulu flew to the farm and arrived about 8.00 a.m .
if you two could keep checking at the farm each day that would be great .
he was having to spend a great deal of time back at the council when he was supposed to be managing the dairy farm !
louie and lulu had been visiting the farm each day .
it was on the next tuesday when louie and lulu made their usual 8.00 a.m. visit to the farm .
what this fellow wanted to do was have a look at the dairy farm then take shufflegrub to lunch .
there could be some cosy arrangements for them both to make money , typically to squeeze out some of the smaller farms .
what a good idea shufflegrub thought , a visit to the dairy farm and a spot of lunch !
shufflegrub suggested that as he was dropping his family ( who were waiting impatiently in the car ) off at the farm that the dairy board chappy follow in his car .
lets fly down to the farm and see what happens !
louie , lulu and pearl quickly left the council and flew off to the farm and waited for the shufflegrubs and the dairy board chappy to arrive .
of course with our trio being on the other side of the quartz in their invisible forms , they could fly at some speed and were at the farm within minutes oh gosh , said lulu , what on earth will happen next ?

gently releasing his arm from jeans fingers the blonde adonis turned to his lads , made a gesture of smoking a cigarette to them and they downed tools , and ambled away to the farm buildings .
this used to be a farm , but for the last twenty years has been allowed to go derelict .
the farm buildings came with the land and they want it done up as their meeting place .
i do nt know when you last went to seagate farm , mate , but there is not enough going on there to keep anyone learning anything for about more than ten minutes .

he looked back at the building ; a somewhat frail looking wooden barn , not unlike the one on olivers farm .

sparky could almost feel his family on the other side of one of the four walls of the room , but he might as well have been back on the farm .

he s been trying to run me off my farm since last spring because i put up a fence so his cows wo nt eat my corn or drink from my water hole .
i suppose his cows used to graze on my farm an drink from my water hole before i put up the fence , and ill admit i did nt get his permission before i moved there , but honest , sheriff , i did nt steal any land from him .
turning back to the farmer mitch said , however , i m afraid your problems are nt over and it probably wo nt be safe to return to your farm , since bomont and his ranch hands will probably be there waiting for you .
i m sheriff within town limits , but your farm is outside those limits .
after all , its your farm he s trying to save .
gus , said mitch as he took a seat at bomonts table in the saloon , i understand you re trying to run joe slug off his farm .
why do nt you tell joe to go on back to his farm and i promise we wo nt hurt him .
and what about their farms ?
you ve got to also guarantee that their farms and crops will not be harmed in any way .
let me repeat , said mitch icily , you ve got to promise me you wo nt do anything to any of their farms !
of course i wo nt do anything to their farms .
and i can expect things to happen on their farms .
you know , it is a wild country out there , and i ca nt spend all my time watching over those farms just so i wo nt be blamed for anything that might happen to them .
` ` he made it clear he wo n't leave your farm alone , although he promised he would n't hurt you or the other farmers personally , '' said mitch .
` ` if they wo n't leave my farm alone , how am i going to raise it ?
if i lose my crop i 'll go broke and lose the farm , and have to move away ! ''
and in that big open country out there , finding actual proof that he hurt your farm will be pretty hard . ''
` ` and if he s flipped , that means there 's no hope for our farms , '' moaned joe slug .
finally , a week after the showdown between mitch and bomont at the saloon , mitch called the four farmers out of their jail cells and announced that they were all going out to joe slug 's farm .
and we 're going to joe 's farm because it is closest to bomont 's ranch and will be the first one he acts against . ''
within the hour , mitch and the farmers headed out of town for joe slug 's farm .
` ` he 's bringin ' 'em here to put pressure on his to give up our farms ! ''
under my plan , joe slug will plant a swath of this grain 30 feet wide all the way around his farm .
that way , if any of bomont 's cows come up to the farm they 'll have as much to eat as if the farm was nt here , since it only had a little bit of grass and sagebrush for them to graze on before joe slug came anyway .
that way , if any of bomont 's cows come up to the farm they 'll have as much to eat as if the farm was nt here , since it only had a little bit of grass and sagebrush for them to graze on before joe slug came anyway .
so if you 'll all pitch inboth farmers and cow handsand help dig a new well about half a mile to the west , that will create a new water hole for the cattle while leaving this one here for joe 's farm .
then the other farmers agreed to grow the special grain around their farms and to help dig the new well for bomont 's cattle .

it was time to run free and be part of something larger than the farm in which they had lived from eager colts to ardent adults .
for generations this had been a bustling farm of nonstop chattering of tens of people .
if this was a park it was a park smelling of cow dung and rotting fence posts , a landscape of hedgerows and gorse bushes and farm machinery , rusting hay - rakes like exotic skeletons made redundant by the season , come summer to collect grasses between their sharpened ribs and weave each strand diametrically .
they walked along the road a way before turning down a deep - rutted farm track , mud and puddles in abundance , but no sign of human life .
the farm itself , when they came upon it , was empty , derelict in parts as if vacated over a period of years .
from the farm they continued cross - country , avoiding the worst of the ground conditions , a circuitous path across fields sloped and hummocked , under which lay centuries of ploughing .

i was nt about to walk a couple miles and work up a sweat just to hang around some smelly old farm while janet looked for scott .
those farm boys are so used to seeing animals mating , they probably think nothing of doing it themselves !

and i also get 25 cents an hour picking vegetables at ramseys farm .
i d asked janet if she wanted to go for the ride , thinking she still might jump at the chance to possibly see her beloved scott again , but she said she and rusty were going to take a bike riding trip to his uncles pig farm in pennford .

until five years ago , the population at large knew nothing of the martian farms ; for whatever reason , the new day party made great efforts to ensure that this piece of history disappeared .
the farms came to public attention with the publication of livestock , a squalid and disarmingly honest account , much of it written by survivors , and the remainder made up of transcripts of interviews .
a short time after the new day rise to power , there was still a lot of talk about the farms , and those who had spent time within the camps began to demonstrate very specific symptoms .
it is safe also to assume , that it was during this period that they began their extermination of the farm refugees .
in the instances of these works , chapters concerning the farms and the invasion of the continent were omitted while final chapters were altered to present the notion that everything was returning to or would soon be returning to - normalcy .

cuddy liked to sit by the old man because it reminded him of his childhood pig farm .
their shorn heads adorned with pink band aids from where the farm shears nicked the scalp .
this fear , and not the sense extravaganza that is pig farming , or living downwind of the pigsty , drove cuddy from the family farm .
i m also suggesting , quite arbitrarily ill concede , you decline any dinner invitation to cuddys house , aka the pig farm .
unlike marys formal schooling at the hands of former formula one race car drivers , cuddy learned to drive every go cart , mini bike , tractor , and farm implement , he could fit in .
filling out his driving portfolio were the years spent slogging farm equipment on nebraskas interstate highway system .
because cuddy had spent his formative years on a working farm , he had an intuitive understanding of animals and knew this child was not to be trifled with .
he could n't help it , he felt it was n't his fault that he was unable to work on pop 's farm .

its quite a walk from here , but i was hoping to go to the hill by the farm where you grew up .
after the third day , though , she began to sleep in the afternoon and would sit silently watching farms and towns roll by when she woke up .
growing up , his father , who had lived the first twenty years of his life on a farm , would probably just go get a shovel or a baseball bat and crush the animals skull to put it out of its misery .
he finds mcgrey farms easily enough , turns right on a gravel road just past the property , continues up a small hill , flicks off his headlights , and turns the car around so that he can see the farm and the police cruiser from where he sits .

and the booters friend is standing by the elevator doors and he s saying holy shit and holy fuck and his first class is standing by him and saying that it makes sense because the motherfuckers already dead and there s no good reason to put other guys in danger , but the booters shaking and he s crying and still saying holy shit and holy fuck , and the first class pulls him away from the elevator door and down the ladder to the mess decks , and you think about that girl you knew from high school who put her mustang ii into a tree over by the thirsk farm flying off that long smooth curve and smashing into that big tree right on the top of the curve , and she died just one month before graduation and how this makes just about as much sense .
with the marak acreage already finished , he had moved on to the masterson farm , where ray rented the land .
renee , ray 's wife , jointly owned the property with her two brothers , both of whom refused to sell their share because they entertained ideas of coming back to immaculate to farm after they retired from their business careers in the suburbs .
ben masterson , shrewder than suspected , managed to buy and pay for a few small surrounding farms , creating a significant property before he died .
having no steady job , the thirty - two - year old drifted from construction jobs to farm work , taking time off in between stints to unload his money , on cars mostly .
in another circle the young farm experts gathered .
from the cab of the combine he looked down on the masterson fields with different feelings than he felt of the marak farm .
josh said to one of the farm boys , ` ` do n't you have to milk cows in the morning ? ''
she chatted with another farm couple neighbors of the hoffmans .
` ` but the farm '' ` ` the farm will be here until the end of time , '' said renee .
` ` but the farm '' ` ` the farm will be here until the end of time , '' said renee .
after shoveling the corn , ethan drove his car to the masterson farm .
but while he enjoyed the earthy smells of the farm mixed with spent hydrocarbons , his pastoral thoughts were interrupted when he brushed the rain from his face and caught a whiff of a perfume that clung to him from the night before .
he felt it would take years to clothe the nakedness of his education , and in his zeal ignored all that he had learned on the farm , his practical knowledge of animals , plants , machinery , and tools .
she cussed at him from the passenger seat when he told her that he must stop at the marak farm before dropping tara off at her house in town .
he told tara all manner of tales about renee on the way to the farm , persuading her to hide .
jimmy , bless his heart , he runs the most - likely - to - be condemned farm in immaculate .
and i ' m taking the girls to the marak farm . ''
he saw the children in the backseat , now on their way to the marak farm .
hygiene aside , he kept a clean farm except the kitchen floor , which his wife shannon swept several times a day to remove the dirt and manure , performing this task between readying three meals , with preparation orders from jack outlawing fruits and vegetables , as his palate only required two staples : meat and potatoes .
run through the trees over there , '' said jacob to tara , pointing at the windbreak of pine trees that lined the north and west sides of the farm .
chopped wood on the farm - he could haul it to the thicket .
jacob looked across the fence , behind the thicket , at the bill frye farm .
the tidy marak farm was buttressed against frye 's junkyard .
` ` you mean , who gets the farm ? ''
` ` you 'll each get half , and one of you can sell it to the other , or you can be buddies and farm together .
he did not feel like a bumpkin , but rather grateful , remembering that the farm offered more and he resolved once again that he could never truly leave it , just as the black calf would never leave it .
each season on the farm was a semester the subject was life and death , birth and disease , hunger and feeding .
` ` that 's why the farm will go to ethan .
in her mind , she and judd already owned the boskie farm , which was for sale .
all the things she never had growing up , she would have with judd on their farm .
she called the marak farm asking for her boyfriend but renee said he already left .
going to the marak farm each morning to help made him want his own place all the more .
milking ray 's hundred - head , raking and sowing the hundreds of acres , eating at renee 's table each day at lunch with her plentiful whole milk and butter and homemade desserts , the seeming largesse of the marak farm gradually increased the want of judd blanks .
likewise , in shannon 's car she sat amid farm dirt and dust , a bill of sale from the feedstore , her grocery list , and the emblem of saint christopher that jack attached to the sun visor , over her head for protection .
a voice called his name and josh turned , surprised to see judd blanks , hands in the pocket of his hooded sweatshirt , still dirty from work on the marak farm .
` ` the boskie farm . ''
between you and me , judd , you 're not the only one wanting to buy that farm , '' said josh , adjusting his collar and speaking lower .
` ` how about your half of the farm ? ''
they make them bigger on the farm than in town . ''
early one spring morning before church , ethan walked through the fields behind the marak farm , alone , checking his gopher traps , shoving dirt around with his hands , occasionally finding one of the traps tripped , with a glass - eyed gopher locked inside , its spine busted .
` ` boskie 's farm would be no financial burden to you , since you can produce nearly two hundred bushels per acre on that soil .
josh continued with a straight face , seeing ray short on humor , and by continuing on the subject lost his other point of finding another buyer for the boskie farm .
think about that farm .
` ` as a child in school , you are taught to think critically , not just in school , but for all aspects of life on the farm , in math class , sports , even in english and social studies .
i ' m gon na buy a farm , '' judd said , stepping past his cousin , into the house .
what have i got since dad let grandpa 's farm go ?
for which farm . ''
you run a clean farm .
now i know you farm , and farmers , i understand , it 's not easy to step over to the conservative side of thinking since there are mixed messages out there '' ray said , ` ` conservation ?
maybe even worse than wasted money are the things that do not have a dollar sign intangible things , like american values , values that were once built on the farm , church , and family the pillars that this country 's greatness rests upon .
and i ' m sure you 'll be expanding the farm now , right ?
the family farm as you and i knew it , it 's done . ''
and with sons to continue the farm , who are willing to stay and continue the name .
` ` you 'll own a farm someday .
thought i could buy the boskie farm , but werther does n't bluff on some things '' ray blinked and decided that he would buy the farm .
thought i could buy the boskie farm , but werther does n't bluff on some things '' ray blinked and decided that he would buy the farm .
he said , ` ` why judd , my boy , i ' m going to buy that farm .
tell you what , '' said ray , ` ` if you want the house , after i buy the farm , i 'll sell it to you .
my kids are getting crazy , and i need a good full - time man , because marak farms is about to be the fastest thing moving in this town .
until then , jacob will get the farm .
ray arrived back at the farm , alone , without ethan or jacob , the former having elected to walk , the latter left behind at dr . parker 's office .
cluttered with events of the day , he pulled into the driveway of the marak farm and parked in front of the barn .
too many things to consider now , with his mind already made up to expand the farm .
and domestic affairs were trifles in the big picture , with that picture being a marak farm that resembled the awed yaren farms .

` ` your name is n't on the title of this farm , renee .
` ` there is still a farm for you , one that neither ray or jacob can have . ''
she said , ` ` this farm , ethan .
i want you to go back to school knowing that you may have lost a small farm today , but gained a larger one .
they clashed at every sentence , with mary coming from a pious farm family and judy coming from a broken home in the city .

it begins with an unattended van filled with hostess twinkies , moves on to a woman in a bar with a tattoo of the liberty bell on her left bicep , then jumps to a thanksgiving dinner he remembers from when he was eight and living on a farm in minnesota , the siege of leningrad , the break up of the beatles , the bouncing ball on the old sing along with mitch show , and a box of animal crackers he ate once while walking actually walking , man , can you believe it ?

sergeant , pull together a party of men and search the farms along the road .

she told him that three wehrmacht men had wandered onto the farm in the last days of the war .
herr bergheim wanted his boys to devote their time to their farm work , and used that as an excuse for them not to accept invitations to join .

when friday came , they ate a hasty meal at the weisse hirsch , then drove to frau bergheims farm .
if they were spending three afternoons in bed at the bergheim farm , they were sure to be discovered , and repercussions would certainly follow .
as the days grew warmer , they would sometimes have herr schuler pack a picnic basket and bring it back to the farm .
she laughed and asked him if he recalled her taking his picture at the bergheim farm .
colling also remembered that elizabeth had brought her camera along on one of their fridays at the farm , more than a month previously , and felt a renewed sense of uneasiness at the thought that she might have been making plans for this journey well in advance of discussing it with him .
the familiar photo she had taken at frau bergheims farm stared back at him .
they have been working on farms near here , waiting for you to come .
he said that they had both been offered work on a farm to the east of the city , about ten kilometers in the country .
if they do not return to the farms where they have been working , there will be questions .
if we can get a farm cart , we can say were a family headed back to our home village .
he gave colling directions to each of the farms where the two men worked .
horses were a mainstay on collings uncles farms in wisconsin , but the three that tomasz showed him were not as large or as healthy - looking .
his facial expression must have betrayed his thoughts , because tomasz explained that the farm owners better horses were out being worked in the fields .
he provided directions to the neighboring farm owned by petr kazowskis , pointing in the direction of the route that would be the shortest .
while he haggled over how much he would pay and whether kazowskis should throw in a set of harness , colling embellished his story considerably , telling kazowskis how he was really buying the cart for use on the farm he had recently purchased jointly with his brother , located near the hungarian frontier .
they found that food could be purchased from the farms they passed along the way to supplement what they carried with them , and elizabeth managed to turn simple fare into passable meals in spite of the difficulty of cooking over an open fire .
he thought back to how uncertain he had been of whether he would be able to use his m-1 during the raid on frau bergheims farm , and tried to reconcile that with the ease and efficiency with which he had used the luger to kill three men within a matter of a minute or two .
when the only suitable place to stop was near a farm , they were careful to ask permission before starting their cooking fire and spreading their blankets .
certainly we will come to a farm or a cottage where we can find shelter .
he managed to find time to stop by and see frau bergheim , and found that both her sons were at the farm , having been released from custody only a week previous to his visit .
when he returned from the farm , colling mentioned the boys release to major brumerson , who told him that amgot had ordered a general review of all convictions of german civilians for violations of occupation regulations that had occurred in the immediate aftermath of the war .
her cover was that she was a farm girl trying to get back to krakow from a labor camp in germany .
the estate actually consisted of a cluster of working tenant farms , and throughout the war they had been better fed than most .
colling had learned to ride his uncle ottos motorcycle , an old indian model , around the country roads near the farm where he spent his summers , but he had to ask hermann to give him some pointers on how to operate the german machine .
his was the farm bordering the camp , and he had seen the russians driving to and from the place on many occasions .
if they attempted the same thing tomorrow , would those in the car find it odd that they would pass the same farm wagons on the same road two days in a row ?
hermann came in a few minutes later and asked why he had not had one of the farm hands see to the horse and cart .
they encountered no checkpoints on what were essentially dirt tracks through farm country .
she gardened and learned all about the farm .
amelia insisted on being there for the birth of the farm animals , even if it was the middle of the night .

as years went by amelia watched as her desire to love matthew and have his child turn into her love for the farm animals and nature .
every spring her love poured out to all of the new babies on the farm and she spent the summer and fall delighting in their growth .
she told him charming stories about the staff or the animals on the farm .

a feast fit for a king , let alone an earl , replied chives , a celebration of the fare found across the estate and tenant farms .
the tenant farms and deer park away to the west , the sprawling hall below and beyond that the lonesome finger of the memorial to the unknown airmen atop a twin hill mirrored on the other side of the great building .
i think i asked for an ant farm also , but i could nt tell yet if i d been lucky enough to get both .
they flipped through a second album , this filled with photographs of peters father and mother as small children , one on the farm , the other in the newly built suburbs of some fair city .
on the jewish side were verdant fields , farms , flower gardens and even luxurious swimming pools filled to overflowing .
his mates and another lot in a 4 - wheel drive did a cross- country run over the hilly back area of a farm without the farmers permission .
hit a rock , busted the sump , split the fuel tank and he abandoned it on the farm .
when he discovered the arse had been torn out of its bottom he phoned me to see if i wanted it for spare parts , conditional on me towing it off the farm .
same year and model as the honda from the farm .
took the sump , drive shaft , fuel tank , and put them onto the farm honda a couple of months ago .
need some drafting for some houses we wan na put up on the farm .
there goes the farm , he thought .
i d like to visit the farm first to check on north / south directions and so on .
but thanks , well see how things go after i arrive on the farm .
he wanted to get to bill and bens farm before midday .
he easily found the farm ; the current house set back about two hundred metres , and centrally located on a broad plateau was probably the only piece of flat land in the district .
he parked on the wide concourse next to a couple of farm quad bikes with trays on the back .
after they learned he had a 210 cubic centimeter deep freeze , they stockpiled his car with the freshly bagged cuts of a whole sheep and various cuts of beef from their farm kills .
important overseas guests were arriving to visit the farm with an eye to purchase it , and they would be staying for a few days .
my father told me that when he was a youngster working on some farms in the backblocks , his employers often used to give employees possum meat in their sandwiches .
my father and the man departed to look around the farm and out - buildings before the threatening ominous low clouds began to drop their contents .
do you help your dad on the farm ?
eventually we sold the farm about four years later .
but when dad died in that horrible car smash just after you were born , it was very tough for mummy to keep the little farm running by herself .
of course ; but without brians help , your mum would ve had to sell the farm .
you know , he let his own farm get quite run down when he was helping your mum .
mum bought sam so i could ride my own horse around the farm .
when horses are old like that , they have a retirement farm , just like an old peoples village .
ill let her go to the special farm .
anyway , your box got put away with lots of stuff in an old garage on the family farm .
you ve still got the farm then ?
so when she visited the farm recently and found out dad had nt sorted out all the stuff , she went ballistic .
what about that massive kauri tree on the farm ?
` ` we came off the farm when all the children had finished school , '' she went on .
he 'd invested the farm sale proceeds into a scheme which he did n't know much about .
way up north , off the farm .
while we walked she carried on telling me about the farm and her parents .
big business has them in these huge factory farm concentration camps in tiny cages too small to turn around in , standing in their own shit , pumped with hormones , antibiotics , and genetically modified feed that causes liver failure in young animals who are slaughtered right before they die of poisoning and disease .
food was proportionately cheaper and more plentiful when this country had thousands of small family farms .
the nearest town was almost six miles away and it looked just like a tiny old west boomtown with one bar and one general store which sold mostly tack , farm implements , and some canned goods .
i am active in factory farm animal rights now , and also into organic non - poisoned food .
the jagged - tipped trees lining the road , the farm fields spread across the hillside , the inky distance : it was night and the view of the fraser valley was obscured by swathes of darkness autumn darkness making the entire landscape look bleak .
you ca n't see anything at night , but this farm is surrounded by other farms , glen said .
you ca n't see anything at night , but this farm is surrounded by other farms , glen said .
he s still on that farm and has about fourteen adopted children , can you believe it ?
he still saw gene often and had planned to go to the farm that night after the reunion .
she was the driving force behind their lumber business , their antique business , their antique reproduction business , their car restoration business , the farm and the yearly camp that brought a dozen foster families to live and work together every summer .
on that old farm ? !
laura remembered the farm and the huge brick house and the obvious lack of money .
she s still pretty good - looking for a farm wife .
eugene had been small fry , a farm boy with an inexplicably exotic car .
she had learned that on the farm of the van fleets had home schooled their children and now were doing the same with some of their grandchildren .
it was even harder for her to reject the idea when george told her about how a half a dozen foster families came to the farm every summer and lived in log cabins and learned to work hard in their cooperative , working alongside the whole van fleet family .
her curiosity about sharon and her serious desire to get some help in dealing with amanda made her decide at last she wanted to go with george to visit the farm .
chapter 4 that saturday laura and george drove to the farm in his porsche .
the cut farm fields passed like countless summers as they swept along the country roads remembering the half remembered turns in life running the gray roads , running into the sun , they were running blindly into a strange almost desperate destiny .
laura was shocked when she saw the farm again for the first time in more than thirty years .
the farm was one surprise after another .
she looked almost spanish in features , and in fact that was her background : her genes had come from the wrecked armada off county cork that emigrated to cape race in newfoundland then to the farm where they had set such massive roots in orphaned children .
i was nt sure that we d meet here at the farm , but there is in notebook with your name on it that eugene has kept all these years that i was one day to deliver to you .
sharon said she would not try to make introductions because there were just too many people between family and friends and people who worked in the farm .
the one thing that everyone on the farm was used to seeing was strange faces .
because arthurs father was an alcoholic , they took the three cases of wine and buried them under an old stone fence on her parents farm .
ambrose bryant van fleet , sara cimek van fleet , lucy doan van fleet , were all adults lived away from the farm .
george asked laura if she would like to see the farm , and when she agreed , sharon stopped tom and asked him to saddle two horses for them .
both horses seemed surprised to be turned back toward the farm and in a few minutes they could see all the buildings from the rise on which lay the farms old settlers cemetery .
both horses seemed surprised to be turned back toward the farm and in a few minutes they could see all the buildings from the rise on which lay the farms old settlers cemetery .
they passed through the cemetery in the slow gait of the horses , lauras anxiety about what she had found on the farm and what she had brought to it still unresolved .
she was feeling energized from the adrenaline rush of what happened at the door of georges apartment , but most especially because of the incredible potential energy that infused every corner of the farm .
ian asked about her day on the farm .
and against all odds , and everyones pessimistic expectation , dinner was absolutely delightful as laura described her days experience at the farm , and the description of it brought out what the farm did to most people , it brought out the heady perfume of pure possibility .
and against all odds , and everyones pessimistic expectation , dinner was absolutely delightful as laura described her days experience at the farm , and the description of it brought out what the farm did to most people , it brought out the heady perfume of pure possibility .
it was also obvious that she was there because she wanted to listen to what laura had to say about the farm .
dear laura , when sharon told me you are coming to the farm i was so delighted and terrified .
i was delighted you d see what our old farm had become , and my beautiful family .
sharon asked amanda if her mother had mentioned her visit to the farm .
amanda asked and was surprised when mary told that she did nt watch television all that much , that everyone on the farm liked making music more than they liked watching it on television .
they talked about music and school and amanda quickly learned that none of the children who lived on the farm went to a traditional school .
you d like the farm ; there s lots to see and lots to do .
she did not want kara to ridicule her or tom or the farm , which she was absolutely sure was what would have happened if amanda had tried to describe the last few hours .
she googled eugene van fleet and it took her to the farms website and a list of all the e - mail addresses of the children .
no matter how she parsed it , there was going to be no way for her to find out unless she went to the farm .
that was when ian realized the emotional impact the farm would have on them all .
amanda was quiet once more until she said , you know how they fix up old cars at the farm .
suddenly the meaningless future seemed to connect to a farm neither one of them had ever seen .
laura commiserated as well as she could , then gave ann marie a brief description of her visit to the farm and her impressions of sharon , and told her about the apparent miracle that it happened in the last day with amanda .
the more laura told her friend about the farm and her impressions of the children , the more envious they admitted to being .
when they talked about lauras visit to the farm and her impressions of sharon , ann marie said that it made her very nervous .
he told her he had shared many of her feelings in the first years after he had come to the farm , but since then he had come to believe that strength was learned from watching strong people , from learning to respect others feelings , even those that were so hard to express .
she gave him a brief background on the farm and eugenes fatal disease and all the adopted children , the cars and the money and the unbelievably fascinating movie of the week story of the van fleet family .
after the first week , they both began to talk about when amanda would come to visit the farm .
for some reason , even though tom had his own car , a 1958 red turtle back volvo , when they spoke of finally meeting , it was always understood that amanda would come to the farm .
her repeated hints to her parents about how nice it would be to visit the farm were greeted without any apparent serious interest .
the story that amanda told her about the farm gave kara the creeps .
weeks after she had first been to the farm , laura phone sharon and asked her if it would be all right if her family came to visit that saturday and stayed for a little bit of the coffeehouse festivities because amanda was frantic about coming .
by the time they got to the farm , laura had decided that no matter how eugene would feel about it , the best thing to do was leave his questions unanswered .
for laura , returning to the farm was like coming to class with an uncompleted assignment .
his fear and apprehension was similar to what laura had felt the first time she approached the farm .
when they turned into the laneway of the farm , both ian and amanda were struck by the sheer scale it .
amanda loved the huge lichen covered stones that eugene had brought the farm and placed like sentinels along the lane way .
but there were only a few people working because it was the hour when everyone on the farm gathered for the midday meal .
tom asked if it would be all right if he took amanda for a ride around the farm .
tom was obviously showing amanda , the steam engine that supplied all the heat and power to the farm and told her to pull on the rope that ran the steam whistle .
they headed across the field to a little cemetery on a rise overlooking the farm .
when they got back to the farm they found their parents sitting in the wicker chairs on the front porch , the wood smell and warmth of the fireplace stripping their bodies of the cool autumn air .
i teach the younger kids here in the farm , so they see me the most .
rosies wife connie seemed to the one person laura met on the farm who seemed to be ill at ease .
tom was , like the farm , too good to be true , her mothers attitude and her own experience with boys at school and on the street said the dark side was not hard to find .
for him , it was simply a matter of her getting on a bus or getting on the train and coming to the farm every weekend .
she sensed that taking that first step alone onto the farm would be submitting herself to its incredible power .
like her mother , she felt the power of the farm and , like her mother , it made her strangely uncomfortable and afraid .
the worst part was that it was just what she wanted , because she loved the farm , she loved tom , but this was so big and so fast that she felt very young and absolutely unprepared .
it seemed that tom had decided that when he was twenty one he would take the money that had accumulated as his part in the family business and go to british columbia and purchase land for his ancestors people and build a native version of the farm to help sustain the people he never knew , the people that were the source of his own blood .
i would nt live on this farm , i would nt have my brothers and sisters , i would nt have my parents , and i never would ve met you .
she tried talking to kara who made fun of the very idea that amanda could be with a farm boy with millions of dollars and sang like an angel and had a body like a statue and was wise and sweet and tender and generous and brave and , wonder of wonder of wonders , loved her , amanda mccall , ordinary , boring , screwed up amanda mccall .
but , they did nt know and so friday , after school , amanda was alone on the train to the farm .
sunday night amanda joined ian and laura at their italian restaurant when she got back from her weekend at the farm .
amanda talked about all the things she did at the farm that weekend .
they are nt exactly into gangstra rap at the farm you know .
the kids on the farm also have to give ten percent of their personal yearly earnings to some charity .
laura thought about how fate was indulging amandas innocence and inexperience with one blessing after another , and the same fate that made her the main instrument that brought tom and the farm into amandas life was turning on her with a vengeance so undeservedly brutal that it just did nt seem fair .
and so george reluctantly agreed to go to the farm with her on saturday afternoon .
friday night , from a little motel room off a cold interstate highway , tom called amanda after a long day of following the big snowstorm , the snowstorm that had buried prince edward county and the farm the night before .
amanda was thrilled to hear his voice but was sorely disappointed when she realized that he was saying that he would be back at the farm sometime late the next afternoon .
it made her smile thinking about the reaction that was waiting for george at the farm this time .
when he was gone the first thing sharon said to ian was that laura was bringing george to the farm because she had asked her to help in breaking off her affair with him .
i ve been trying to call from here at the hospital but there s only the answering machine with your message saying to call the farm .
you ll stay at the farm .
kara teased amanda about her description of coffee night at the farm , where were going , i do nt think anyone is gon na be singing kum by ah .
tom had called the farm after he hung up the phone at the mccalls apartment .
she stood stone frozen in the borrowed clothes sharon had thrust at ian as he had left the farm , her swollen face covered in lines of dried blood , her sore eyes staring at the lovely , innocent , unblemished face of the beautiful daughter to whom she had given life , for all that it was worth .
wayne always felt like a city boy and left the farm when he was 2twenty one to start the antique business in toronto .
that was before the family made antique reproductions or had made a science out of picking antiques from old century farms .
when wayne refused to go into rehabilitation , eugene left the farm for the first time in his life and moved in with his son and paid for the heroin , worked in the antique store and cruised gay bars and , for two years , became a part of waynes life .
that was why the long drive back to the farm was so hard for tom .
amanda learned about her mothers affair a few days after tom went home to the farm for the first time since her attack .
she thought about the feeble traditions that her family had to show their feelings for each other , and remembered the wall of photographs in the dining room at the farm and envied all the pictures of all the birthdays and all the christmases .
i wish that school was like it was on the farm .
amanda exploded in joy at the idea because she had been hoping that tom would ask her to come to the farm for christmas .
she told her that christmas day on the farm was a sea of bodies but she would very much like to spend some time with her .
she said that tom would also feel that her coming to the farm was a very small way of showing his gratitude for what she had done for amanda .
it was amanda pressing that made everyone get through breakfast very quickly , and she made it clear she hoped everyone would shower and dress , post haste , because she did nt want to miss anything at the farm .
chapter 10 that christmas at the farm was like a blown glass decoration rolling unsteadily between the opposite edges of a table , between joy and sadness , celebration and loss .
usually it was only on christmas that birth parents came to the farm , yet even that was nt a common occurrence , and there was an underlying tension and sadness that came with them that no gracious welcome ever seemed to relieve .
the great farm and the enormous happy mixed family seemed to overwhelm the small birth families that came to visit .
one of the best parts of christmas presents was making or creating something on the farm in secret , a surprise where it was so difficult to keep secrets and surprises .
the mccalls pulled into the parking lot at the farm and they were immediately uncomfortable with the fact that they had come bearing no presents .
carrying them back to the farm had in fact been the first thing that made laura realize how excited she was at the idea of doing a book of short stories from them .
the farm was transformed by the smells and colors and shapes of christmas celebration .
the exotic location was the farm .
the last child in the tour was the youngest child david who was unable to speak or communicate , and so his brothers and sisters had led him around the farm and told their own memories of what they had seen , watching david and his father together .
listening to each child described eugene with the son who could not speak or respond was , in a way , like describing how they had been when they first had come to the farm .
each child had come to the farm like david in a way , and their descriptions of seeing him with eugene were even more poignant than their own personal memories of how he had been with them .
it was the only time the grown children ever brought food to the farm .
tom and amanda offered to give ann marie the quick tour of the farm and ian asked if it would be all right if he joined them .
the breathless feeling for amanda , as she toured the buildings on the farm , was that she was helplessly aware that she might be looking at her future .
or would they actually create another copy of the farm among people she did nt know , people that did nt even know they were coming , people of a race that might see her as an outsider .
he knew the atmosphere of the farm would give her the strength to risk rejection and failure .
these were really just simple farm folks , but above the simplicity were absolutely extraordinary lives .
ian wanted to know who was responsible for the grand vision of the farm .
so who was responsible for all the different businesses that you have here at the farm ?
as ian thought about it , he realized that that was what made the farm so strange and so wonderful , the past was everywhere , the place was like an immovable foundation that just grew and grew .
i loved that he would stop at farms and buy huge old boulders from farmers and bring them home on the lumber truck .
he wondered if the damage went as deep as the person she was when she had long ago first come to the farm .
sharon told amanda that the younger children had been playing her cd all morning in the music room and it was definitely the biggest hit to ever appear at the farm .
it was hard to feel alone on the farm and before the weekend was over , ian felt he belonged there , like an old shoe in a closet .
there were love stories everywhere on the farm ; difficult , unfulfilled , intense little love stories .
it seemed that rosies wife connie was the one person who truly resented the farm .
she had reluctantly agreed to let her children come to school there and she saw her life as an ongoing battle to try to keep her children from being swallowed up by the farm the way she believed it had swallowed her husband and everyone else who had ever come there .
tom says that she calls the farm the good jonestown .
somehow a school project at the farm seemed to be more than just another make - work project that was irrelevant to anything in real - life .
and there was something about the farm that made amanda feel a personal connection to those people and that time .
how ironic it was that it had only been since they both had become connected to the farm , when they had both undergone the most horrible , helpless tragedy of their lives that help had come to them in such a powerful way from ann marie and the whole van fleet family .
even the constant background music of the farm had invaded lauras consciousness .
they had become and were becoming a part of the farm and he was stuck in the city .
on the farm , laura and amanda rarely saw one another , except for meals , and when they slept close , and rose together in the morning .
tom explained to her that the meat came from a local farm that raised fryers .
almost immediately , she thought of the place where she had felt safest and most protected on the farm and knew it was the place she would want to spend an hour in silence by herself .
but the excitement of seeing them and joining them on the farm was balanced by the sad knowledge that he was going there to bring them home .
yet bringing them back from the farm and all that it offered them was like denying them the best part of life .
he began to fantasize about quitting his job and asking for work on the farm .
and he knew lauras stay on the farm was only temporary at best .
he missed his family so much he had to turn up the volume of the cd player playing his own daughters voice on the cd copy tom had made for him before he had left the farm .
wayne had invited ann marie to come back to the farm for new years eve but she declined because she said that she wanted to be near her computer , just in case there was another secondhand message from her daughter .
she continued , its interesting that you d be attracted to such a city girl and that shed fit in so well here at the farm .
why do you think amanda fits in so well here at the farm ?
everyone except him had found some purpose on the farm , and he felt more anxious than jealous , because his had always been the role of the organizer who maintained the busy mechanism of his familys life .
the steady wind and the snowstorm had quickly buried the farm in wet heavy clots of snow , the cedars and the rose canes already bending under their weight .
by the next day the farm was buried in wind and white and the red massey harris tractor with the big snow blower had to make runs every few hours to keep the lane ways and buildings of the farm open and accessible .
by the next day the farm was buried in wind and white and the red massey harris tractor with the big snow blower had to make runs every few hours to keep the lane ways and buildings of the farm open and accessible .
chapter 11 wayne and charles left just past noon as the wind rose and the snow drove itself into the white silhouettes already on every vertical surface of the farm .
at the farm it was business as usual except that the lane ways the snow blower kept open sank beneath white cliffs of heavy snow .
amanda moved into the routine on the farm as if she had lived there her whole life .
as the storm got worse and the city succumbed to paralysis , he thought every day about somehow getting to the railway station and taking a train back to the farm .
and it was disconcerting for him to realize that the only people he really wanted to talk to that were nt on the farm were wayne and ann marie .
growing up in my teens on the farm , with about the best parents anybody could ever ask for , did nt help to make me believe my best feelings meant any more than my worst ones .
it seemed that megan knew about amandas rape from her mothers email , and waynes friend had told her how amanda was now living at the farm with laura .
when laura mentioned to ian the next day that megan had been sending email messages to amanda for the past week , he was very excited , and when he realized that laura had actually gotten very little information from amanda about those messages he quickly ended his daily call with laura and phoned up to the farm to get amanda on the phone to get a fuller report .
in the three days before megan replied to toms message the phone lines were busy with megans name as the center of many conversations between the farm and toronto .
ian quickly phoned and debriefed amanda about her previous weeks messages and how it came to be that megan was writing to her at the farm .
what tom was encouraging megan to do came from what he had gone through when he came to the farm to live .
before he moved to the farm , when his frustrations and his pain overwhelmed him , he would almost always strike out , and he would punch whoever was at hand .
the very first time he did it after he came to the farm , sharon had talked to him alone and made it perfectly clear that anger was perfectly permissible at the farm but violence was absolutely forbidden .
the very first time he did it after he came to the farm , sharon had talked to him alone and made it perfectly clear that anger was perfectly permissible at the farm but violence was absolutely forbidden .
every one of his brothers and sisters had seen and suffered physical violence , which would not be allowed to happen at the farm .
the thought first struck her when she was walking from the cabin to the farm .
it was not long before the story of the two imaginary young people falling in love with all the time in the world , exploring the first summer of soaring hearts , raised the memory of her own first summer at the farm with eugene .
they were two farm children who had known each other all their lives , who had fallen love on the yellow school bus coming and going from two farmhouse doors .
doing chores does nt have to be a requirement for you , you may be the one special case that s ever come to the farm , but if you d like to help for half an hour with dishes after breakfast or dinner , it might be a good idea .
she felt and understood the respect everyone on the farm seemed to have for what she was doing .
how did you ever decide to become a priest , growing up here on the farm ?
she did nt want to admit that her daughter was now part of the farm , even if her fears about its power and influence had diminished .
by the time they got back to the farm from the train station , laura was already with eugene working on the book .
the first six weeks of every year at the farm saw each saturday and many evenings taken up with the children practicing on the big oval course in the pasture for the ice races to come in mid february .
each entrant would only be able to race two cars in the haystack island ice race weekend where anyone who showed up with a car that had been restored at the farm could participate .
like most city people , she always thought that farm folks had very simple pleasures and so she was very surprised that her saturday visit to the farm would include powerful adrenaline rushes that were actually fun .
like most city people , she always thought that farm folks had very simple pleasures and so she was very surprised that her saturday visit to the farm would include powerful adrenaline rushes that were actually fun .
as it was with so many material things on the farm , automobiles were so much more than their practical purpose .
the older van fleet children who lived off the farm stayed home because they were tired after the long day of racing practice .
it was an old favorite at the farm , and everyone knew the words , except amanda , as she sat quietly opposite eugene .
later that week , one of the few mysteries created since laura and amanda had been at the farm was solved .
no one knew where amanda went during the hour of silence and solitude everyone who lived on the farm enjoyed each weekday at four o clock .
the most they would know , the most she would ever tell them of how she was finally reborn , was that it happened in the root cellar on the farm .
on the way back to the farm ryan , who was the expert on pre - war disney , showed everyone a mickey mouse organ grinder he purchased for eighty five dollars .
martha answered , its when we go picking with the cube van on back roads up north on old century farms that we really make money .
the rest of the weekend went by with the usual strange sense of time that seemed to exist on the farm .
there did nt seem to be enough time to fit in all the possible things that were going on around the farm .
chapter 12 over the next few weeks the mccalls fit into the routine life of the farm as if they had never had a past history anywhere else .
ian came to the farm every friday night and went back sunday afternoon .
even for him , his real life seemed to be on the farm .
his heart and mind never left the farm when he did .
but that day she had learned from sharon that she was going to be treated like all the other children and all the other workers on the farm .
amanda and laura had been thought of as special cases when they came to the farm , so the idea of their working there did not seem to apply .
whether at school or at work , everyone on the farm earned twenty dollars an hour .
sharon said that everybody on the farm lives on their earnings so they wo nt forget that money comes from working hard .
do you realize how much money we have been saving since you both came to the farm ?
ann marie wrote back each day with her own news of the weather , her news from the farm shed gleaned from ian , and what she could share about her own experiences in the past day .
before long , megan was encouraging her mother to go to the farm to visit .
and although ann marie had come to like the farm , she still felt like a fifth wheel .
the best she could do for megan was to call ian on the phone after his weekends at the farm and debrief him about what he had been doing , how laura was doing with the book , how tom and amanda were getting on .
amanda thought about how her own pampered childhood was so lonely compared to the second childhood she had discovered at the farm .
the farm had been swarming with people and old cars since before breakfast , but it seemed that the volunteers were so familiar with the traditions and routines of race day that by the time the van fleets loaded up eugene and a van full of baked goods , the races were ready to start at the lake .
a crowd of well over five hundred people had gathered for the ice races that day , and a significant number of them were wandering through the parking lot with ian and laura seeing who was there , greeting old friends , renewing connections that had all begun on the farm .
almost all of the entrants were children from the foster families who had come every summer for so many years to work on the farm .
learning the basics of automobile repair in the huge garage on the farm , seeing old rusty wrecks become even better than new was usually interesting enough for young children .
from the time they could afford to do it , the van fleets had offered the foster children on the farm the first chance to having their own cars done for them .
they were offered interest free loans up to ten thousand dollars that they could pay for with their own sweat equity working at all the other necessary tasks on the farm .
the ice races were more than nostalgia for those who had come to maturity at the farm , it was going down into the basement and seeing the stone foundation of their lives that had set in those early years of restorations .
laura was back at the gas grill doing custom order burgers , chatting with people while they waited , slowly getting a sense of the life stories of the people who came and went , who had come to the farm and had never really left its influence behind .
to her , sharon was the enormous generator of power that made the farm what it was , and she was surprised that people barely mentioned her when they talked about their past histories on the farm .
to her , sharon was the enormous generator of power that made the farm what it was , and she was surprised that people barely mentioned her when they talked about their past histories on the farm .
yet what people seemed to remember most about their experiences at the farm involved eugene and practical things like the restoration of their cars , the organization of races and picnics , the lending of equipment , or the gifts of truckloads of lumber .
both women were obviously delighted to see one another , the old city connection come to the farm , placing them in a situation neither of them could have ever even imagined through most of their long relationship .
she would have to be there vicariously and so ann marie had finally agreed to go up to the farm and see what all the fuss was about .
every consideration was usually extended to the people visiting the farm .
it was george marshall driving his porsche , the porsche that had been perfectly repaired in the garages of the farm .
sharon had made clear to george that he was nt welcome at the farm as long as laura and amanda were there .
he had called a number of times when he was drunk to protest what he felt was his arbitrary exclusion from the farm .
the ice races were the only times that george felt there was much glory to be had in any of the activities on the farm .
driving drunk , driving suspended , he made his way to the farm to make the point that he still existed and would nt be written off .
ian had already left when sharon arrived and she quickly instructed that george be taken up to the farm house where he could dry out overnight before he would be allowed to leave .
laura had nt thought of leaving or even needing a car since she had come to the farm , but the idea of having her own transportation appealed to her , even though she knew that there was always a car she could borrow .
laura had never seen alcohol anywhere on the farm except on the dining room table .
that was another thing at the farm where only the best would do .
he wanted someone to understand how things changed and were the same and how the farm had transformed his life and how he felt so far away from it , like he was floating in space watching himself sitting there sipping his amber drink .
chapter 13 for amanda , it was another exciting week at the farm because her 71 riviera arrived and it was off the trailer and on a hoist within an hour , and amanda was there under it , wearing coveralls for the first time in her life , coveralls she would wear almost every day until the car looked more perfect and polished than it had when it had been new .
laura felt the great routines of nature stirring something inside her the way the routines of her life at the farm had done .
the nightmare of her life was balanced , in a strange way , by the sweet time she took to herself to spend on the street with the boy alan , and the sweetest time of all spent pouring her heart and her circumstances out to the boy far away on a farm , a boy who she was now certain that she loved .
he would send megan the money for a plane ticket home to her mother or she could come and stay at the farm until she was better .
the invitation ripped megans heart because she wanted more than anything to go to the farm and be with tom , but having just seen her face she just could nt do it .
at the farm , every spring , in march and april , two or three times a month , expeditions were planned to visit century farms , looking for antiques .
at the farm , every spring , in march and april , two or three times a month , expeditions were planned to visit century farms , looking for antiques .
it was the time before spring planting when a farm family could be counted on to be near the farmhouse , to be able to make a decision about selling an old piece of furniture , an old family heirloom .
tom was anything but enthusiastic about the trip and both martha and amanda could sense it , but they did nt understand that the reason that tom was reluctant to go away from the farm was because of what was going on in vancouver with megan .
the fact that he was not only encouraging her to come home to her mother as the best case , but even to the farm if that was the only alternative , made him realize that he was creating a situation where he was going to hurt either megan or amanda or both of them , but the alternative of letting megan find her way in the world without any support just was nt acceptable to him .
wayne had called tom on the cell phone they were carrying in the cube van to ask him for one exception , he asked to be allowed to talk to ian about the problem when he came back from the farm sunday night because he had an idea of how ian might be able to help get megan and the boy to toronto .
tom and amanda and martha set out at dawn on saturday morning in the big empty white truck hoping to come back with it filled with unknown treasures from farms that were some of the earliest settlements in upper canada , some nearly two hundred years old .
she had also packed sandwiches and fruit and drinks for lunch , because she did nt want to spend one moment in a restaurant when they could be going door - to - door seeking out treasures that might be waiting behind every new old farm door .
learning they were farm folks too , usually sealed their welcome .
after tea , tom asked if they might look in the barn and any of their old sheds for antiques the farm folks might not want to keep , and the farmer and his wife both dressed in their coats and led the way out into the sheltering square stockade of the old log barns .
tom explained to the farm couple that their pitcher was probably worth several thousand dollars and they should take it into the house for safe keeping .
in the barn stable , as two draft horses stared out of their stalls , tom sat on a straw bale with his sister martha as they went over the list of things , making estimates of value that glazed the eyes of the simple farm couple who stood silently and watched the two children talk like experts antique appraisers .
it took fifteen minutes in the strange kind of time the farm couple clearly did nt understand , but there in the barn , tom wrote out a list of the items that he and martha had agreed they would like to purchase and the amount of money they would be willing to pay for them .
tom gave the farm couple the written list and the dollar amounts and their eyes got wider and more frightened as they saw they were being offered a total of three thousand eight hundred dollars for their old things .
amanda felt like a displaced person whenever the subject of history and artifacts had come up on the farm .
and for tom , the horror and the outrage was actually personal and frightening because he had made friends with one in the foster children from the farm who had often come to the saturday night coffeehouses even after he left university and was in medical school .
boxes in boxes in boxes , and amanda noticed the boxes for the first time and the motel room felt very small and empty compared to the places they had visited that day , compared to the farm they had left behind .
she knew farm people were up with the dawn and she did nt want to miss one minute of the great treasure hunt .
when he was finished , he had martha turn off the truck and the three of them walked up the lane way to the farm .
the kitchen where they sat was surprisingly spare , not unlike the cabins on the van fleet farm .
tom described the farm and his family and the circumstances that made fourteen strangers into brothers and sisters , and he described his parents and all they had done to make them happy and prosperous and secure .
as amanda listened and martha got more anxious to be discussing antiques , amanda realized the reclusive woman was overwhelmed by the description of the farm the same way she had been overwhelmed by its reality .
the quiet simplicity and the deep sensitivity she had found in an old reclusive woman was somehow even bigger and more beautiful than toms family and farm .
the next morning began a day that would completely transform amandas life at the farm .
they would be coming to the farm the next day .
he had explained that the boy was not interested in going to the farm ; he wanted to stay in the city because the idea of living on a farm just was nt something he wanted to do .
he had explained that the boy was not interested in going to the farm ; he wanted to stay in the city because the idea of living on a farm just was nt something he wanted to do .
what was worse was when he told her that ann marie and megan would be coming the next day to talk to sharon to see if there was a way to work out a plan so that that megan would be staying at the farm indefinitely .
he had explained everything about where the boy would be staying and how they would be going to the farm to talk to sharon and how the plane would be coming that afternoon .
wayne had transformed the program that had evolved at the farm to one that would work with street children needing and wanting some kind of intervention and help .
she was very nervous about the tentative plans for megan going to live at the farm , and the idea she would have to give up her work and go to live there with her was one thing that she was desperately hoping she would not have to do .
by then i was living at the farm and starting to feel like i belonged to a real family and then i was feeling things that i thought would make them reject me all over again .
i loved the farm and sharon and eugene , and even some of my brothers and sisters .
at the farm , you just ca nt get away from it for a second , you know what finally got me off heroin , besides my dad following me everywhere ?
his context was not the city , his context connected his hands and his heart and his mind the way it happened at the farm .
ann marie and megan would be going to the farm the next morning to talk with sharon and tom .
she had changed her appearance entirely , trying to imagine how people dressed on the farm , what she would have to look like to fit in and belong .
style was nt substance at the farm .
she understood that megan was perhaps only there for the night and megans real hope was that they would take her at the farm where she could be with tom .
your mother knows her way around the farm already and after we have tea , you probably have time before lunch to let her show you the place .
from what she had understood , it would be up to her to decide if she was willing to come to live at the farm with megan .
she wanted to ask if seeing tom with amanda was the reason she changed to mind about coming to stay at the farm , but if it was true , she had no idea of the reaction she would get .
she knew her mother did nt want to come to live at the farm .
thanks to tom , secondhand , megan really did know a lot about the farm .
it always happens on the farm .
they had nt even bothered to tell him that laura was at the farm with amanda .
the accidental death , the rape , the queer agents of karma , lauras connection to eugene , the impact of the farm in all its ramifications , the book from the letters of two fictitious teenagers named arthur and laura lee .
laura did nt know there was a model for the farm that was nearly two centuries old , and that a secular model of hands to work ; hearts to family could still be so powerful .
the farm had even turned a young girl who had sold sex a dozen times a day into one who just thought about it a whole lot .
like everyone else , she longed for sexual contact , but somehow it had to be left behind with the rest of the world , out past the lane way to the farm .
ian and alan had come to the farm with wayne and charles on friday evening .
she also had a big pack of photos taken around the farm since she had been there .
after that ian and laura mostly listened from the front seat as miss brown and amanda and allen sat and talked like old friends , amanda going on about the van fleet family farm and the music and the gardens and the art studio , and the grove of walnuts a century old .
ian and laura listened with a mix of delight and regret that the few months amanda had spent at the farm was everything she had to say about her life .
back at the farm , while wayne and charles and martha brought the furniture out of the barn to the truck parked nearby , anne marie and tom and megan wrapped and secured each piece in heavy packing blankets , each leg wrapped individually , each piece wrapped completely .
she had been glad that their nightly email conversations had ended when megan had come to the farm and , until that day , almost all of their free time had been the three of them together .
he could nt get over how incredibly exciting and absolutely unpredictable life could be at the farm .
they were feelings he always suspected were there , but at the farm , she had a harder time covering them .
its just so not what you expect on a farm .
every year eugene and sharon , with the advice of their children , would find a great teacher , a great doer , a great thinker , a great artist to come to the farm so their children would know what a real passion for life was about , passion that did nt just come from their parents or from their own lives .
over the years , marshall mcluhan , alan bloom , kim ontdaatje , wynton marsallis , christopher lasch and bernice reagon were some of the teachers who had come to the farm before sawyer strickland , and had stood with the van fleet family for a group portrait when their week together was done .
and i do nt understand how he thinks he s going to go back to his people with all kinds of money and make a farm like this .
ann marie and megan chose very different places to go for the solitary hour everyone on the farm had between four and five .
he pointed out the huge pile of branches that had been hauled from the bush and were waiting to be fed into the chipping machine that filled the dump truck that went to the farm to fill the hopper car of the locomotive to supply the heat and electricity for the farm .
he pointed out the huge pile of branches that had been hauled from the bush and were waiting to be fed into the chipping machine that filled the dump truck that went to the farm to fill the hopper car of the locomotive to supply the heat and electricity for the farm .
after all the years of shared sympathy for all the devil in the details of their lives , the reference lines between them had been so absolutely altered by the circumstances that had brought them to the farm , that it was frustratingly difficult for the old friends to know how to speak to each other .
amanda and megan and tom were just another emotional triangle on the farm , like laura and sharon and eugene ; like laura and ann marie and ian , and even like the one between sharon and laura and ian .
it would be a month before the memorial service in the little town near the farm would end toms search .
it was such a contrast , the way spring had taken over the farm that month with sweet new life .
without realizing it at first , she started to answer the questions he left her the first day george had brought her to visit him at the farm .
from the book they were creating , from the depth of his understanding of the innocence of the young , to the enormous network of human beings who had come to the farm and been changed , taking away some of the inexhaustible treasure of eugenes optimism and confidence , they would ve been so surprised at what an unambitious boy who only wanted to use his hands to make a living , had done with them .
she realized and remembered the loneliness and the distance that an only child feels growing up with two successful professional parents , and she realized the suffering in her daughters lonely childhood , the suffering that only appeared to be there in the last year before they had come to the farm .
for megan , adapting to the farm was so easy that she could nt believe that a person could be so normal , so quickly , so completely .
in the month that he spent on the internet looking for news about his friend charles , tom was almost out of touch with the social life on the farm because he spent so many of his free hours searching the world of refugees and war crimes .
he told her about the time before the farm and she told him about the drugs and the lost friends and the loneliness that was like a thirst that she thought would just never end .
and so it was that her first evening meal away from the farm was with the man who was the quiet , practical backbone of the entire little family empire .
her expenses at the farm were literally nothing , a fact that was almost embarrassing when amanda brought her her weekly paycheck .
the liquor laws are a little looser here than the farm .
inside the house , lauras wine glass was re - filled as she greeted the children who she knew from when they came to the farm to go to school each weekday .
unlike all of the van fleet children , the grandchildren just thought laura was another person at the farm .
every time she had seen them at the farm with their children , they had seemed like a happy couple .
connie went on to explain that the home schooling at the farm was one of the two issues she and rosie could nt resolve .
everybody thinks everything on the farm is so perfect .
the farms not real .
you have any idea how hard it is to fit in to the rest of the world when all you know is that farm ?
there is nt anyone who s left the farm that had trouble fitting in to the world , except christa and she was losing control two years before she decided she had to go .
you know very well that what i mean about not fitting into the world is that growing up on the farm makes the rest of the world seem small and unreal and unworthy .
it was a feeling she had had from the moment she first drove down that farm lane way .
she had been nervous , feeling that connie was right , but she could nt for the life of her understand what was wrong with what the farm was doing to her and amanda .
i think i ve probably already lost amanda to the farm .
when you re at the farm , you re connected to people and you feel their connections to you .
the reason people feel they belong at the farm is because they feel part of something bigger than they are .
rosie hates it , but i call the farm the good jonestown .
it was something that was at the heart of her own life , and was probably the most crucial issue she had to face in deciding to come to live at the farm .
for me the bottom - line is the farm means more to rosie than his own family .
you really mean that you resent that the farm means more to me than your opinion of it .
this is your home , not that farm .
i wonder if i m going to lose my husband and my daughter to the farm , whether it will mean more to them then i do ?
the farm does nt separate people ; it connects them .
have you ever been closer as a family than you have since you came to the farm ?
i do nt know what well do without the farm .
the other thing that rosie and i have never been able to reconcile about the farm was how much people had to give up to be a part of it .
the farm had him enthralled even more than it had amanda .
since we came to the farm , nothing .
the wine kept flowing and the conversation got lighter and laura felt like a smart , tipsy middle - class lady again , not someone pretending to be a part of the capitalist walden that was the farm .
when laura suggested that she get tom to come and stay with her , the silence at the farm was like the silence in the walk - in cooler in the kitchen when the door closed in the cold .
does the farm really feel like home ?
when she got back to the farm after breakfast , laura was surprised to see sharon waiting for her on the porch .
what does she want from us , to abandon our lives , to sell the farm ?
laura was surprise that she actually wanted to reassure sharon of her loyalty , and so she told her what amanda had said about the farm .
amanda says she did nt think anyone really ever leaves the farm .
the next day was mothers day and it was , of course , one of the sweetest celebrations that happened at the farm .
it was so tender , the moment belonging to the very place where they lay , to the darkness , to the distant stars , to the rising moon , and to the enfolding farm .
he had left the farm after lunch , all alone , and it was all very mysterious .
since the farm , they did nt seem to know how to fight anymore .
seeing the city from the farm looked so frantic and so sad , everybody desperate to have enough to prove that they really were somebody .
the city sure ai nt the farm .
it was the following week that the bleeding heart of europe flowed on to the farm .
they were coming to the farm to live in the cabins that were used by the foster families .
purpose had come to the farm for ann marie with the wounds of six hundred years of hatred .
sharon knew she had to get back to the farm if she could .
the kosovar refugees were already at the farm when sharon returned with tom and amanda .
the only problem was the outrage among the refugee men when they asked for wine and sharon told them there would be no alcohol allowed on the farm , except at dinner .
over the next three weeks , the refugees turned the farm up side down .
people were crying on the other end of the phone telling sharon how hard it would be without the money and the personal support the farm gave them .
never had the farm felt so strange and foreign as when the refugees came to stay .
there were those who said that their suffering did nt entitle them to take over the farm .
it was amanda who suggested they have a formal meeting that night to try to resolve some of the questions and problems between the farm and the refugees .
that night , while sharon did eugenes physiotherapy , she told him how her she felt and she actually admitted that she wished she had never asked the refugees to come to the farm .
she thought she did nt show it and did nt say anything to anyone , but she felt herself slipping back into the useless depression that came with the feeling that she just did nt belong at the farm .
it was the first time the farm had failed anyone , or so she thought .
the less she connected to the busy life on the farm , the happier and safer she felt .
in all the emotional intensity of the farm , in all the emotional depth of her own work , standing on the emotional precipice of her feelings for eugene , laura felt happy for the first time in her life .
in the room no one else had entered since he had come to the farm , tom savored another moment of pleasure , and the moment became moments in the black room and he felt pleasures he did nt know he could feel , and he felt her soft , hard body move over him and he was inside her before he could even imagine protesting .
it was after four o clock on the third day since he left that tom drove down the lane of the farm .
a few days later was a hot dry day when everyone had worked very hard setting up the stage for the canada day concert and picnic that was the highlight of the summer at the farm .
some people brought picnics , some ate fast food , and it was the only day of the year at the farm when people could celebrate with beer and wine .
as tom drove down the lane of the farm , the headlights glowing between the long serpentine stone walls , sharon was lying asleep next to eugene as she had every night since he had his last crisis .
eugene had left sharon and each of his children printed extensions of the journals he kept by hand all their years on the farm .
she always wished she was as beautiful as others always told her she was and that s why she always made herself up for others , until she came back to the farm .
at the farm , mourning was the same and different for everyone who loved eugene .
miss brown declined any food or beverage and she told amanda , very directly , that what she would like to do , after speaking to sharon , was see the farm .
it was obvious to amanda that the desire to see the farm was so the two of them could have some time alone .
after the tour of the farm , amanda insisted that miss brown stay the night and not go back to be alone in the motel in picton .
it was slightly uncomfortable asking if miss brown would mind sharing her double bed , because all the other beds at the farm were taken .
there would be a service in the screened chapel beneath the walnut tree , just for the family and the people on the farm .
sharon worried about why christa had nt arrived because she had no idea she would be caught in the traffic streaming onto the farm .
i was with tom and martha looking for antiques on old farms .
christa asked bridget brown about her farm and her life and she heard the story of the lady , the recluse , and then amanda made her tell about her sculptures and quilts and the lady slipper orchids .
amanda realized suddenly , that what the farm was to the city , miss browns place was to the farm .
amanda realized suddenly , that what the farm was to the city , miss browns place was to the farm .
under low clouds , in the brisk wind under the sheet lightning that seemed to take a very long time to pass by , the van fleet children sang through the afternoon , picking through the best moments and greatest hits of their life on the farm ; being sisters and brothers who had once been lost in the world .
the long wait for eugenes death slowly stretched every person on the farm ; and the tightening made it possible to reach notes inside that were deeper and higher than anything they had been capable of feeling in their lives .
christa had already explained to him and her mother that she had decided to accept miss browns invitation and go to stay with her at her farm the next day .
it was nt depression that hit the farm so much as it was the reality of every present moment , and without eugenes living imagination those moments were somehow almost impossible to face head on .
it was strange but they were nt worried , because the one thing certain on the farm was that everyone made sure everyone was safe .
almost every one of eugenes children on the farm was doing exactly what laura was doing .
the regular practical routines on the farm had vanished that day .
we want to spend one more year working on the farm , if its okay .
there would have been no beautiful farm , no foster families , no millions of dollars , no roses , no antiques , no bridget brown for her daughter to love .
she dug a pit in the sand then put the notebooks in it with the loose leaves of his printed memories since she had come back to the farm .
you can stay here on the farm as long as you want to do that .
i have the kids , the farm , enough great memories for another lifetime .
that was how the city was different than the farm .
on the farm , the future seemed to carry the momentum of the past , much of what had been , would be .
it was a stripped down version of the van fleet farm , without all the people , and all the furious activity .
she had her own future and , if it was nt connected to the farm , it would be far away and years in the making .
pre - marital sex was nt encouraged on the farm , and the van fleet children could nt even be alone with a member of the opposite sex before they were sixteen .
she reminded them of things they had done when they were just new to the farm .
even on the farm , tradition and generations , and the old order of things had been fundamentally displaced by the children of opportunity .
the more ian went on about the beautiful results in their lives since they had come to the farm , the more laura seemed to withdraw .
no one had been loved as laura had been since she had come to the farm .
no one had found love as she had found it when she had come to the farm .
in a way , lauras depression became part of everyones consciousness at the farm .
i do nt want to be a farm girl .
that was how anthony holtz ended up coming to the farm .
on the way back to the farm , ian spent most of the time talking about house plans and construction , and he was excited to learn that the van fleets had book shelves of plans and ideas for houses collected over many years .
ian consumed books on construction while alan poured through plans and the piles of magazines ian had borrowed from the farm .
near the end of the week she looked up and saw the smaller of the farm tractors coming down the beach , its front end loader bucket raised high , amanda driving all by herself .
can you honestly tell me you felt less not more since you came the farm ?
when ian was at the farm , it seemed they were always together .
amandas questions about toms plan to start a farm on vancouver island had to be addressed and answered .
since she moved to the farm , amanda felt she knew something of what that meant too .
the van fleet farm was like an old apple tree producing bushel after bushel of sweet , heavy fruit , while the farm in their dreams was a sapling with only its first heavy blossoms .
the van fleet farm was like an old apple tree producing bushel after bushel of sweet , heavy fruit , while the farm in their dreams was a sapling with only its first heavy blossoms .
the only income they would have would be what laura was paid at the farm .
he was staying with amanda in their old cabin when he was at the farm .
before he left , laura learned that he had planned to stay the weekend and learning that , she told him that she would prefer it if he stayed the rest of the weekend in the guest room at the farm .
both anthony and laura were surprised that the farm had literally shut down during the mornings the years special teacher came to the home school .
amanda left her mother holding the phone , explaining that she had work to do at the farm .
once again breaking the farm rules on alcohol use , tom and amanda , sharon and ian , and anthony holtz had come for a nightcap , and while ian opened the bottles of dandelion wine that bridget brown had sent with him for amandas hope chest , tom and amanda took firewood from where it was piled on the deck and built a bonfire on the beach .
said the boche would soon be bombing the farms and i suppose she was right .
when dulcie and i were small , after father died , mother took us to a farm in shropshire .
dulcie and i ran in the fields like wild things , went to the village girls ' school and played amongst the farm animals .
most of the time it was heaven at the farm and almost like the war was a whole world away .
of course it all changed in ' 51 when the germans began the indiscriminate incendiary bombing of farms .
the papers say that we are winning the aerial war now and that the blockade of hamburg is hampering their fuel supplies from russia , so perhaps our english farms are safer for now .
thank god for the american imports that break the atlantic blockade and for the irish and their ' one big farm ' mentality .
i suppose that 's why we loved the farm so much , where we were allowed to roam free .
she met him when he came to oversee the kentish farms and he stayed for a while at her bed and breakfast place .
one second she is eating food on the couch , then she s on the top of the staircase , then tara is reading to her old macdonald had a farm and then they are even doing gymnastics together .
they land on the heap of fruit and vegetable scraps belowtheir home , his worm farm .
using worm farms and composting methods to deal with organic waste is not new .
so what is it about worm farms and composting that s so good ?
the rust - stained bathtubs have been converted to worm farms .
these features are the key differences between a compost and a worm farm .
when we do nt compost our food waste or use it in a worm farm , we squander its potential to be transformed into the black gold bhuva speaks of .
they shook hands and an overfed farm hand with black heavy metal hair got out of the passenger seat .
his parents owned a corn farm in iowa , but he looked as if he d been raised by aristocrats in an english country house and had just stepped off the cover of gq magazine .
as far as my father was concerned , michaels small - town upbringing on a farm in the midwest was the icing on the cake .
slowly he would rise above the city itself , above the apartment blocks and highways , the river and the industrial estates , until patchwork farms came into focus , racing off in graph like precision towards the next smoke choked metropolis .
i noticed a carrier generator outside the building of a farm , yet learned that a natural gas generation facility is not allowed .
its funny because i ve spent many an hour fixing fences on three sides of my farm , but never on sammys side .
they got a couple farms to do , then mine .
as we drove by their farm , she said , poor samuel .
at six p.m. , samuel rode back into his farm with sarah and gaped .
the farms with their white houses and barns , clotheslines hanging low with their burden of simple clothes , and picturesque pastures that looked like something from a painting .
chapter 3 it was 1861 , and the family farm had the johnson boys by the balls .
the problem was , after paul was gone , ma and edward would have to hire a farm hand .
bonesy put out his hand , uncurled his fingers , and there , in his grimy palm lay three small gold nuggets , enough to buy , perhaps , a little farm of their own .
mostly they re in rural areas , like the farms and ranches .
its dotted with farms and ranches out that way .
a husky man with a bushy , graying mustache , perhaps sixty , said , a couple was killed at a farm twenty kilometers north .
she and her husband have a small farm there .
attacks on two farms fifty miles from there .
i sit on the top layer of the deep terrace farms , for hours all alone and i truly enjoy my peace and leisure .
she moves out of her room and walks alone to her favorite spot on top of the terraced farms , which offers a wide - open vista she likes most .
a family of stupendous wealth , whose riches came from a shipping empire unimaginable in its extent , i ca nt imagine it myself , as a poor farm girl from indiana , and she was the kind of woman who , oh , knew what was what , and who was who , and maybe where was where , and she was the kind of woman who knew on a first - name basis all the very best , highest quality people in the southwest .
oh , its a wonderful year in western ohio , at least , near abouts where their farm is .
would be nice to see the old farm again , too .
mothers name was in the front , because she played the piano , very well i might add , for the meetings which were sometimes at the old farm in michigan .
a farm movement .
i was a michigan farm girl and i could nt say for sure about what might or might not have been happening in chicago .
i went to school in a one - room schoolhouse with lots of tough boys from the surrounding farms , and they did nt give a hoot about school , but they never would have been so craven as to hide their bad papers from their own mothers .
she knew nothing about ranch life , although she did know quite a bit about life on a small farm in indiana .
she made connections easily with middleclass midwesterners , people from indiana and ohio , people from small town america , like her , that knew about small farms and hard times , people who were midwest friendly .
about vast orange groves and cotton farms and peanut farms , too .
about vast orange groves and cotton farms and peanut farms , too .
they kept her locked in the cellar ... god forgive them for what they did to her because she no more knew what she was doing that the puppet knows its master ... what an old story it is ... and all of this happening about twelve years ago and her left abandoned out on her own for the longest time ... oh , about two years , i expect , on the old family farm and it had one of the biggest cellars in all of the county , they say .
they kept up with the crops planted on the old farms , even knowing the names of the seed varieties , and the work of the fields and they enjoyed journeys to the farms in arizona .
they kept up with the crops planted on the old farms , even knowing the names of the seed varieties , and the work of the fields and they enjoyed journeys to the farms in arizona .
living so long on this dry edge of the earth had been a little much for her ; and i wonder now what anguish she felt every time her relatives went back to the old farm without her and her little pride with her place in the strange west must have been weak compensation for the loss of friendships and established course of her life , pots of jam at the county fair and known plants and animals , that she felt every time she was left in this strange place called arizona by them , by the folks .
i m a farm girl , remember .
we just have kid records like stuff about farms and mornin chores .
i m doing a story on that sect that took over the old wilson farm .
there are a lot of lost souls mostly college dropouts at the farm .
we lived on a kibbutz , a communal farm , in the upper galilee .
she was just a girl , twelve maybe , always skinny and all the more so back on the farm , during those hard years .
this is back in southwestern kansas , on their farm .
there are a couple shots of the farm too , depressing wide vistas of bare land with nothing growing .
when prices were dropping and farms were failing , even before the dust storms got so bad , he realized it would ripple across everybody else too .
he read reports , he came to see that the newer farm techniques were bad for the land .
but that was what it took to loosen their fathers grip on the failed farm .
how it was all new to them , leaving their failed farm behind them and seeking out a better life .
it will add a couple hundred miles at least to drive up to the edge of kansas and try to locate where the old family farm used to stand .
but you re not going to find anything like the family farm near santa fe .
chapter 6 caleb on the farm its only a couple days into our grand journey to follow grandma veras migrant trail , and i m wondering if well whip through it in a week and end up camping at the closest free blm camp to home , waiting for our friend the professor to vacate the house and let us back into our lives .
we do nt even have to exchange words about it i know shell want to be able to take pictures as we approach the farm .
and not long after they all took up their farms , cultivation technology changed .
no farm either , no one familys land , no proud owners .

instead , she glanced back into the coffin and took one last look at the woman who befriended her at the farm .
chapter 3 carina 's home was about a mile inland , in a far ritzier part of town than i can afford , just past the outer edge of the northeast quadrant of the city , where trees covered more ground than the buildings and all the roads were paved , where increasing numbers of country villas were replacing the old farms , driving the farmers further out .
a half - mile further on 28 he turned right on a newly paved single - lane private road that led him through his neighbors christmas tree farm , then up the hill to his house and winery .
even if some junk collector , noticing the front wheel of the schwinn glinting in the ditch had stopped for the bike and found the body , how the hell could the tragic and brutal death of an itinerant , piss - smelling farm worker possibly be connected with darren elmore ?

i think its quaint that our neighbor runs a christmas tree farm .
at a christmas tree farm ?
after stopping at kfc for dinner ( the family ten piece special with fixins served loody nicely ) he made a few phone calls and arranged for a late night party at mackeys christmas tree farm .
mackey was a cousin of loodys older brothers second ex - wife , so he was practically family , and he did nt mind them getting together for some loud music , a bonfire , drinking , target practice , and open - air screwing at the christmas tree farm a couple of times a month throughout the summer .
asshole darren had gotten it in his mind that if loody and his idiot friends whooped it up a few times a month at the christmas tree farm mackey would sell and he could plant that portion of land with his pissant wine grapes .
maybe one of these days loody would divert the party from the christmas tree farm to one of darrens precious vineyards and see how he liked it .
riffs from a country song eddie could nt recognize sounded sporadically from the bottom of the hill , near that godamn christmas tree farm .
down by the fucking christmas tree farm .
through the pristine postcard beauty of the dry creek valley they viewed wineries that resembled faux chteaux , modern churches , severe industrial chic boxes , and redone farm houses .
i know you and bridget always have something to talk about : the ayuda foundation and the plight of the poor , put upon , migrant mexican farm worker .

the hollowed tree in the copse where he had built a camp , the small brook that ran into the copse from broadhurst farm where sarah was on some days with her labrador .
then he remembered that daniel lived almost two miles beyond broadhurst farm .
a few hundred yards ahead he saw a roadside farm track .
stephan 's father is always working on the farm . '
he backed into the farm track , checked briefly for traffic , then turned out heading back the way they 'd come .
' no , just under a kilometre more - it 's on a rough track between two farms . '
though only the top of it from where he was : the river bank dipped down sharply from the farm track and the car must also be very low slung , he thought .
even if they had , their position was shielded from the passing farm track by the high wheat sheaves .
he had started to think about the farm , and it filled his dream .
for a moment more his father stood looking blankly across the fields , then finally turned resignedly and headed back across the farm courtyard to the back kitchen door .
he could never remember the grass being that long , and now that he could n't see the farm he 'd lost all direction .
' he was with poullain at tourtin 's farm when it happened .
' the man from the farm behind , marius caurin .
this track provides the only access to his farm .
four monique rosselot looked out onto the farm courtyard .
they ' ve had to work so hard to make a go of that farm , they were sold a real pig in the poke .
the rosselot 's farmhouse formed an l - shape around the courtyard , with the garage and some farm store rooms coming out at an angle from the main house .
some freckles showed on his forehead and arms from the summer sun , his shoulders and forearms were broad from the years of farm work , and there were calluses on his rough hands .
but there the farm labourer ended : his eyes were soft and inquisitive and he had a vaguely intellectual air , as if he was an accountant or lecturer who farmed just at the weekends .
' about six hundred metres down the road , a track cuts between our neighbour and the next farm .
it goes between two more farms for half a kilometre , then comes out on the main taragnon - bauriac road .
he goes along the main road through taragnon village , and the farm is just over a kilometre past . '
christian was found on a farm track little more than half a kilometre from the maillots ' farm , but on the other side of the road bordering the river .
christian was found on a farm track little more than half a kilometre from the maillots ' farm , but on the other side of the road bordering the river .
on a fresh page dominic had been making a small diagram of taragnon : the path from the rosselots to the main road , the maillots farm , and the track by the river .
' so finally you made the call to the police station just before 5 pm , when it was clear that your son had not turned up the maillots ' farm and you had found the bike abandoned . '
' your son was originally discovered at about three - fifteen by a neighbouring farmer , just half a kilometre from the maillots farm .
he was a casual farm labourer who filled in with some local poaching .
it was a sixth of a page entry describing the discovery of the boy by a local farm worker and the police questioning of people in the village .
apparently he 's working at raulin 's farm most of tomorrow , but we should try and get to him by eleven - thirty , before he has a chance to hit the bars . '
still , it had only been a casual visit to the farm where machanaud had been working that morning , the true test would come tomorrow with the official interview in the gendarmerie .
the supposition was therefore that beforehand the boy and his assailant had been by the riverbank , mostly obscured by trees and bushes from the bordering farm lane , or somewhere else ?
though i went over to broadhurst farm the other day with kevin .
' it 's only four or five miles away , and broadhurst farm is just at the back .
dominic timed and dated an interview form , and made notes as poullain started with machanaud 's main background details : age : 39 ; town of birth : st girons ; place of residence : seillons ; occupation : farm labourer .
' so you left after finishing work at raulin 's farm at about eleven , is that right ? '
poullain spent the next ten minutes running through machanaud 's movements : bar fontainouille at 12.15pm , leaving just before 2 pm for gilbert albrieux ' farm where he 'd planted some vines the february past .
the only thing we know for sure is that you were seen at three o'clock by madame villan , coming out of the lane at breuille 's farm . '
' are you trying to tell me that this boy was found on the lane to breuille 's farm ? '
the timing was etched on his mind : arrived at 1.38 , left at 2.51 , three minutes drive to the farm lane , eight minutes off the road with the boy , heading off again at 3.02 .
clarisse rosselot had stayed with the fivets during monique 's daily hospital vigils so that jean - luc 's farm work was n't too heavily disrupted .
monique rosselot had hardly left the farm since receiving the news , asking the fivets to get whatever shopping and essentials were needed .
jean - luc had meanwhile buried himself back in his farm work , was out in the fields much of the day .
it was the pond at broadhurst farm .
eyran wondered how far it was to broadhurst farm .
he wondered if he closed his eyes and willed it hard , if his mind could sail across the farm fields to broadhurst farm , put an image in his mind so that when he went back to sleep his dreams might take him there again .
he wondered if he closed his eyes and willed it hard , if his mind could sail across the farm fields to broadhurst farm , put an image in his mind so that when he went back to sleep his dreams might take him there again .
perhaps he would ask his uncle stuart to drive past broadhurst farm the next day .
some of it was at the hospital , some at the farm where i used to play . '
' is that the farm we drove past the other day , just down from your old house ? '
stuart pulled into the first available farm gate entrance .
probably driving by the old house and the farm fields had sparked it off .
chapeau backed into a side farm track a hundred yards along from the main gates of the chteau on the opposite side of the road .
the next few rows were taken up with village people who had an acquaintance or vague connection with the rosselots : various shopkeepers monique visited regularly , jean - luc 's farm equipment and seed suppliers , the family doctor , louis and valeri .
lambourne prompted by mentioning their play areas by the old house : the copse and the woods at the back , the wheat field at broadhurst farm .
the next hearing was the reconstruction to take place at brieulle 's farm : present should be the suspect , defence and prosecution , and all relevant police and medics who attended at the original scene .
foliage further down the riverbank was thin , the view virtually clear ; most of the foliage and trees were clustered along the bank 's ridge bordering the farm track .
the small bridge connecting the neighbouring farm to breuille 's wheat field was in the police report as ' where we think the boy crossed ' , mainly because there were no sightings of him walking through the village itself .
i only heard the noise and the direction it was travelling - up towards caurin 's farm . '
marius caurin owned the farm behind and was the first to discover the boy .
naugier wrote in the name , and added : 3.16 - 18 : caurin returns to his farm and discovers boy .
as they made their way back up the river bank and onto the lane , dominic noticed a figure in the distance towards brieulle 's farm .
a day in the life of a low - life vagabond : some casual farm labour followed by a few swift eau de vies , then heading out half drunk for some poaching .
looked like a farm worker out for the day , thought molet .
nor did he pass through from the farm behind , it was too far out of his way - and besides marius caurin would have seen him .
in between the rambling , in the moments marinella had been able to impose some structure to the session , she 'd been able to find out the names of both his mother and father and how far the farm was from the local village , taragnon .
' is it a big farm ? '
now that she knew lambourne would n't expect her to push more on the shared loss link between the two boys , she relaxed and returned to general information , filled in gaps from what they 'd learned so far : how often gigio went to the local village , his full name , his school , the name of the street by their farm , and friends and neighbours .
she gradually wound things down , let gigio finish his description of discovering an old car tyre one day on his way home from school with a friend , and how they rolled it back to the farm - then brought eyran back out of hypnosis .
the scent of the fields reminded him of the day he 'd found christian 's bike , of days they 'd spent together working on the farm ... of the bleak wheat field with the gendarmes placed like markers .
the land , the fight to make the farm work , had been sapping him dry the last few years .
i use a good farm shop in kensington church street just round the corner from where i live .
you went to the farm shop just round the corner from my house , asked about me , they were completely obliging .
you do n't sound like a farm labourer yourself . ''
running roughly parallel to it , winding along the edge of the moors , often with heather sweeping right down to the road on one side , and farm fields on the other , is a country lane .
along that country lane is a short string of stone built farms and houses and a pub that together make up burley woodhead .
if walters was in the farm house and had taken hostages , they did nt want to rush in with guns blazing .
he glanced towards the early twentieth - century farm house to ensure their arrival had not been detected .
he cradled her while he quickly ran away from the farm house and walters .
we want to get the farm up and running first .
i ve never been on a working farm , boone said suspiciously , but this does nt look right .
` ` and his farm ? ''
in the meantime , his father ran into trouble on the family farm .

in fact , his time on the baxter farm had nothing to do with pleasure .
but , the killer chose this set of targets only for what lay hidden on the girls farm .
until he stole it from them , the girls never knew about the riches hidden on their farm .
the need for money , enough wealth to bankroll him into old age , brought him to the baxter farm searching for what he knew lay hidden there .
knowing how much longer the money would allow him to keep going drew him to the baxter farm .
so he sought out the baxter farm , because he knew what tom baxter left buried there many years before .
in addition to being a working dairy farm , it also provided a wooded paradise along the riverside .
the farm was a pleasant place with cool breezes during the summer , and shaded camping spots beside the moreau river .
it took him almost the entire year he spent on the baxter farm to find it .
the helper now lay in a shallow grave in an isolated corner of the farm .
his cellmate joe holman knew what lay buried on the farm , but nobody else .
he already knew what tom baxter buried on his farm , but he did nt know where to find it .
the things their father left buried on the farm before he went to prison would have easily saved them , but they did nt know about it .
in addition to growing fond of the two girls , the killer had also grown fond of the farm itself after spending almost a year living there .
the farm was just as the old man described it .
the old man he travelled with described the baxter farm in his letters from prison .
the old mans descriptions of the farm were strong and arose from his own love of the place .
ironically , he had never seen the farm .
the old man had only seen the farm in his dreams and imagination .
the killer befriended the old man , and even offered him the promise of a little love if he could only share time on the baxter farm with him .
once they reached the farm , the killer thought he no longer needed him .
when he died , the sad old man spent less than a full day on the farm he spent years dreaming of in prison .
the killer told david what he hoped to find on the farm .
the killer wanted to leave the farm in a few hours .
besides , when the police came around , they might find some sign of the great treasure that once lay buried on the farm .
he had what he needed , and nobody knew about the bodies he left on the farm .
the killer had lost three of them somewhere on the baxter farm .
it would take time , but the mess he left behind on the baxter farm would come back on him in ways he could nt yet imagine .
she loved the farm she inherited from her parents .
cindy wanted her children to grow up on the same farm .
she rode it around the farm looking for joe holman .
the man invented a variety of stories to explain his constant digging around the farm .
she said the same thing about cindys sister stephanie , and then threw in something about how they would lose the farm if they did nt come up with a ton of money in a hurry .
she had a point , losing the family farm is n't funny .
cindy and stephanie live on a farm that s been in the baxter family for over a hundred years .
he persuaded them he wanted to start a restaurant and got them to borrow against the farm to fund his idea .
cindy baxter had no idea what joe holman found buried on her farm .
she only knew he found something worth a fortune buried on her farm .
jack also said he never knew about baxter being involved in anything illegal , or having anything hidden on the farm .
i planned to go search the baxter farm and see what my suspect left behind when he left .
chapter 4 i intended to visit the baxter farm early the next day , but that did nt happen .
cindy left a note saying she would expect me at the farm later .
i carried the coffee and donuts to the car and drove out to the baxter farm .
with her hair pulled back in a bun , and that oversized white shirt she looked a bit like a 19th century farm wife .
it looked like mckay and holman used the baxter girls just to get their hands on what tom baxter left buried on the farm .
so i started with an inspection tour of the holes the man dug while he searched the farm .
stephanie gave me directions and a hand - drawn map of the farm with the holes joe holman made marked on it .
suddenly i did nt like the idea of poking around all those holes joe holman left on the baxter farm .
i still did nt know what joe holman and david mckay found and removed from the baxter farm .
the killer probably persuaded david mckay to join him , and then killed him when he found whatever tom baxter buried on his farm .
now i not only did nt know what he stole from the baxter farm , i no longer had a suspect either , at least not one with a name .
i wrote down a few notes from my conversation with holmans sister for my file on the baxter case and started driving over to the baxter farm .
if i never recovered whatever the killer removed from the baxter farm , then i d never see a paycheck .
the three of them had spent several days together in the time since he left the baxter farm .
he had a failing business he planned to sell back home at an inflated price , he had the loot he removed from the baxter farm , and he had amber mercers inheritance .
whatever the man who passed himself off as joe holman removed from the farm had something to with tom baxters shady past .
the irony was , depending on what that something turned out to be , it might also make the baxter girls very rich , save their farm from the bank , and guarantee them a bright future .
the only thing i knew about what he took from the baxter farm was it required two people to carry it to the truck , but it was small enough it only required one truck and one trip and did not require special equipment .
tom baxter got it to his farm , and hid it there , without attracting attention .
i had no name for my suspect , and i had no idea what he took from the baxter farm .
so that morning , right after erin got the phone call from cindy about the case , i left for the baxter farm .
when i returned to the baxter farm , i needed to ask both the girls about their fathers past .
he had a plan to bring his life back from the dead once he left prison , and it all centered around the goods he left buried on the farm .
tom baxter 's farm had a buried secret on it somewhere , and joe holman knew what it was .
i eventually broke the silence left by the bill collectors departure , and asked cindy if she knew anybody who served with her father back during his army dayssomebody who would know what he might have buried on the farm .
his route would take him right to the baxter farm .
i knew that because it was the only farm along this road .
he reached the farm right before i got there .
i only about made it half way up the long , private driveway leading back to the farm road when i saw howard greenes car approaching .
i think they make a habit of keeping dead bodies piled up around the farm .
he thinks the girls were running some sort of gangland racket on their farm so he got the prosecutors office to go along with it .
he sold the judge on the idea tom baxter had valuable government property hidden on his farm and the john doe suspect , along with the baxter sisters , hatched a scheme to dig it up and sell it .
they made it sound like bad behavior always passes along from parent to child , and so there must have been something evil going on at the baxter farm because they were related .
he knew what tom baxter kept hidden on his farm , and he might know the name of my john doe suspect .
we think tom baxter buried something on the family farm , something another person stole .
i did nt really need to ask , it had to be what my john doe suspect lifted from the baxter farm .
but now i knew what my suspect lifted from the baxter farm .
he met up with my john doe suspect right after he got out of jail and went with him to the baxter farm .
i bet he s the same guy who killed david mckay and joe holman , i said leaving out any mention of the buried loot on the baxter farm .
for the moment , the cops cared more about the killings , but they knew baxter had something valuable buried on his farm .
my theory at this point was that john doe wanted the money he could lift from brian mason to fund his existence until he found the gold buried on the baxter farm .
if he already had the loot from the baxter farm and from the brian mason house , then why did he need to go looking for another victim ?
she said he was searching for something on this chicks farm or something like that .
he probably read about joe holmans body being found on the farm , and knew we found brian masons body .
it started to sound like they had started a kind of shelter out on that farm of theirs .
in reality , the two had escaped and run off to live with an uncle on a farm in wyoming .
if uncle sam took baxters gold , it would force the baxter girls into bankruptcy and that beautiful farm of theirs would end up just another ugly subdivision or a shopping center .
he had tracked the suspect from the baxter farm , and figured out it all tied back to tom baxters smuggling days , but he had no idea what to do next .
this was a long way from the baxter farm in moreau county .
chapter 22 not long after i returned to moreau county , i went out to the baxter farm .
this farm really is spectacular .
after he shut down his current life , he would disappear with the money he raised from selling his businesses , the money he stole from amber , and the gold he took from the baxter farm .

my father was a vietnamese farm boy .
in his state of semi - consciousness , he wondered if he would dream again tonight , dream his favorite dream , the one in which he leisurely places his hands around his wife 's neck and in something approaching a sexual orgasm , presses and presses until her voice leaves her and her eyes begin to bulge and her tongue protrudes from her mouth , and then the neck and the whole body go limp , like a broken cornstalk he remembered as a child on the farm , and as with that broken cornstalk , he would casually throw gertrude 's body to one side , free at long last of that voice he swore was recorded in hell .

logan owned the farm .
it took several months , but the house and bar sold , and matt bought instead a condo downtown and the farm , at least i thought he had .
how did they occupy the farm so quickly ?
of course if the farm belonged to logan , kat had known , and yet she 'd never said a word .
why are you ... why are we living on a farm that belongs to sculpt ? ''
` ` and the farm ? ''
i do n't know when that was set up or why , but sculpt emptied out his account the day he left , gave everything to kite and told him to buy a farm in the company 's name that had room for horses and immediate occupancy .
all of it , to buy the farm . ''
` ` kite asked us never to tell you sculpt and him owned the farm .
i 'd told him my dream of having my own horse farm and helping abused horses , and now i was living it .
yeah , i hate finding out sculpt owns the farm .
we 'd also go see georgie who recently was n't making it out to the farm as often to see us .
helped out , you know with moving to the farm and shit .
since we 'd moved to the farm , we made it a habit to visit georgie whenever we stayed at the condo .

i was going to have my own farm , my business , and help save the horses that needed me .

i told her about the farm and the horses then suggested she come by and i 'd take her riding .
once he got back , i knew things would have to change , and i did realize that i may have to move from the farm sooner than i had anticipated .
` ` farm is logan 's .
if i helped his horse then word would spread and i could gain more cliental which meant having my own farm sooner than i planned .
since she knew nothing about the farm or where to find me , i had n't spoken to her in years .
but he 'd leave with the band again , and i 'd leave his farm .
even though logan had given me the ability to have my dream , it was n't my farm .
and she was n't traipsing off to every dick 's farm alone , not fuckin ' now .
kat and i had stayed on the main floor since we 'd moved onto the farm .
deck had relocated his mother , and emily was safe at the farm with deck and his men making certain nothing touched her .
we made it back to the farm record time , though logan took care to obey most traffic laws .
just promise you wo n't leave the farm .
` ` alfonzo has no clue about the farm .
why logan came with me to rob 's farm to work with the racehorse .
deck 's doing security and is confident that the farm is still safe .
deck says it 's highly unlikely alfonzo can find out about the farm unless he 's been following any of us , which i told you , deck 's men has made certain he has n't .
do n't leave the farm , emily .
this was logan 's farm , and i know he 'd say different , but it felt like his , not mine .
` ` call the police , and have an ambulance meet us at the farm . ''
deck said alfonzo had surfaced , but neither of them thought he 'd link the farm to emily .
they 'd taken precautions just in case , had security at the party , kept a man following them whenever any of them came to the farm to make certain they were n't tailed .
i had n't talked to him about buying my own farm , and yet , he knew .
it read : ` ` you ' ve worked hard to make the farm a place for horses to heal .
the rent you paid matt went toward the down payment i made on the farm .
i know you 'd never be happy to live on my farm , so now it 's yours , and you earned it .
the farm has always been yours , baby .
he certainly did n't look like he could run his date farm all on his own , but he was adamant that he could .
if he thought he could handle the farm by himself , he was probably right .
you 're busy with the farm and i get that .
i 'd been working alongside them on the farm , harvesting dates and helping out , and i was going to miss them all .
` ` so after high school was over and i left palm valley , i found out my uncle had a heart attack and i went back to help him on the date farm . ''
uncle jim owned a date farm on the outskirts of palm valley .
i was the only family member at his side and helped him with his farm for a few months until he was back on his feet .
the date farm was at the very end of the road , lined with rows and rows of palms .
work on a farm for room and board ?
there was nothing but small farms in the area , a place that would probably seem very bucolic during the day but looked lifeless and deserted at night .
we were walking together between the rows of date palms on her uncle jim 's farm .
the fire spread like a blanket of lava over the valley , faster and thicker until it reached her uncle 's farm .
that , combined with the steaming cups of coffee and the vintage posters of farm life on the walls , did work as a wonderful front .
i swallowed and nodded , watching the immense land , the countless farms and houses flying past .
it looked like a farm - not exactly the place i had been picturing in my head .
sure , on the date farm i had a ladder to help me but the way this tree 's branches were spaced out it was like a ladder anyway .
ian was a guy standing on the outside of the glass , looking in at the rest of us shuffling back and forth , doing the same thing every day , taking the same paths , like ants in an ant farm .
if we like the deal , then we accept it and i 'll have to move to wherever their single - a farm team is . ''
` ` you going to the farm , too ? ''
` ` you 're going to the farm , right ? ''
` ` yeah , i ' m going to the farm , '' i say quietly .
` ` the farm , '' he says , getting all excited again .
it 's actually called cast - a - way farms , based on the brochures i saw yesterday .
if i ' m correct , we have a few hours to go until we get to cast - a - way farms .
the owner of the farm . ''
she goes back and forth to my apartment in the city with me , even though i ' m sure she likes it more here on the farm .
` ` that would be like the boys saying they live at cast - a - way farms after staying for a week . ''
i grew up on a hobby farm with a lot of horses , so originally i wanted to be a large animal vet .

bree continued : ` ` he said to his friend , ' if the british march by land or sea from the town tonight , hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch of the north church tower as a signal light- one if by land , and two if by sea ; and i on the opposite shore will be , ready to ride and spread the alarm through every middlesex village and farm , for the country folk to be up and to arm .

wednesday morning near 10 of the clock - watertown to all the friends of american liberty be it known that this morning before break of day , a brigade , consisting of about 1,000 to 1,200 men landed at phip 's farm at cambridge and marched to lexington , where they found a company of our colony militia in arms , upon whom they fired without any provocation and killed six men and wounded four others .
an alarm is raised regarding prowling bands of negroes , who have despoiled a number of farms near wilmington and brunswick .
` ` they came from the same estate ; a small highland farm called broch tuarach - it was known locally as lallybroch .
a beautiful highland farm , with woods and streams ; even a bit of fertile ground - rare for the highlands .
madame came to my sitting room each morning , to consult me on the menu for the day , and to present me with the list of expenditures deemed necessary for the provisioning of the kitchen - fruit , vegetables , butter , and milk from a farm just outside the city , delivered fresh each morning , fish caught from the seine and sold from a barrow in the street , along with fresh mussels that poked their sealed black curves from heaps of wilting waterweed .
i saw jamie 's head rise , and fix as he saw the home farm of lallybroch below .
a pickpocket 's prospects for employment on a farm seemed limited .
fergus , worn out by his abrupt introduction to farm life , simply sat down where he was and stared numbly at the floor between his legs .
lallybroch absorbed jamie at once , as though he had never left , and i found myself pulled effortlessly into the current of farm life as well .
lallybroch was remote , even for a highland farm .
i left the house then , to do my errands for the day , calling on two of the cottages near the west end of the farm .
for a highland estate , lallybroch was prosperous ; but that was saying something only by comparison with other highland farms .
alone among the highland farms , i was sure , the women of lallybroch waulked their wool not only to the old traditional chants but also to the rhythms of moliere and piron .
jamie , and ian with him , talking together in gaelic , in the comfortable , unemphatic manner that meant they were discussing farm matters .
two hundred miles from the coast , you were beyond the ken of city and farm .
i did n't hazard a guess as to how difficult fergus might find it to carve a farm and homestead out of a howling wilderness with one hand , no matter how fertile the ground .
the letter continued in this vein , giving more news of family , but dealing more often with the business of the farm , and reports of events in the district .
my fame - if that 's the word - as a healer soon spread outside our tiny settlement , and i found myself called farther and farther afield , to tend the ills of folk on isolated hill farms scattered over thirty miles of wild mountain terrain .
at first , jamie had insisted that he or ian must go with me to the farther places , but it was soon apparent that neither of them could be spared ; it was time for the first planting , with ground to break and harrow , corn and barley to be planted , to say nothing of the usual chores required to keep a small farm running .
the birth i had attended at the muellers ' farm now seemed vague and insubstantial in my mind ; i thought i had better record the details while i still recalled them at all .
he had come to the farm several days before , as part of a hunting party from anna ooka , on the trail of bear .
jamie seemed less than enthralled at the prospect of having mummified bodies perched in the trees near the farm .
it was nearly two days ride from salem to the ridge , and the nearest german lutheran farm was at least fifteen miles away , over rough country .
however , the day before the first sign of measles appeared , a small band of indians had stopped at the mueller farm asking for food and drink .
terribly upset by the scalps , the pastor had gone in search of herr mueller , only to find that the patriarch had nailed his grisly trophies to the barn and then left the farm , bound - he had said - for fraser 's ridge , to see me .
the mueller farm was several days ride from the mountain line that separated indian territory from the settlements , but he could have reached several tuscarora or cherokee villages , depending on his direction .
fraser 's ridge lay directly between mueller 's farm and the indian villages - which at the moment seemed distinctly the wrong place to be .
he was kindness itself to me , when i went to the farm to help with petronella 's baby . ''
the only real difference between this farmyard and modern ones she had seen was the absence of rusting farm equipment ; there was a shovel resting against the barn , and two or three battered plowshares in a shed that they passed , but no ramshackle tractor ; no tangles of wire and scattered metal scraps .
claire had gone with lizzie as escort to attend a birth at one of the farms at the far side of the cove ; if the child had n't arrived before sunset , they would stay the night at the lachlans ' .
lizzie was to stay and help marsali , who had her hands full with the distillery , little germaine , and the farm work that fergus could n't manage single - handed .
` ` my father had a tiny farm , not too far from here .
i ' m a good manager , though - i can keep accounts , and i think i know how to run a farm .
she thought briefly of her mother 's penicillin farm , less briefly of her mother , and her throat closed tight .
roger was doing his best to assist with the other farm chores , though hampered by his lame foot .
not much call for the skills of either a historian or a folk singer , on an eighteenth - century hill farm .
` ` my father was away - gone to a funeral at the next farm .
it seemed likely that he came from a fairly wealthy family , judging from the brief description he had given me of their farm estate .
ten pounds sterling here was half the yearly income of a small farm ; i could n't imagine a single escaped prisoner was worth that much to the english government .
he 's a widower , and he 's the lease of a small farm .
while i dinna pretend to know all there is to know , i ' ve lived a good bit of my life on a farm , and unless people are verra different from other animals , it isna going to take that long to do what we have to .
our farm was near the forest , ye see , and i spent a good deal of time there , hunting , or seeking cows as had got out and suchlike .
i expect they 'll hear ye at the next farm ; you ' ve got good lungs . ''
i knew there was a barn and a shed for silage ; these must be to the other side of the house , with the farm 's granary and the henyard , kailyard , and disused chapel .
everyone in it seemed to stir into immediate life at cockcrow , and the farm then spun and whirred like a complicated bit of clockwork until after sunset , when one by one the cogs and wheels that made it run began to fall away , rolling off into the dark to seek supper and bed , only to reappear like magic in their proper places in the morning .
we sat for a short time after dinner in the parlor next evening , ian and jamie talking over the farm 's business in the corner , accompanied by a decanter of elderberry wine , while jenny relaxed at last with her swollen ankles propped on a hassock .
the moth - eaten mule that had brought the macnabs to the farm shambled out of the yard where it had been enjoying the hospitality of the estate .
the whitewashed farm buildings glowed amber in the setting sun .
here , sitting on the top rail of a fenced field , we could see the whole of the home farm laid out before us .
but they 'll have sent someone back to keep an eye on the farm , just in case .
he could see the sense of finding as many of the backcountry scots as possible now , before they scattered away to their farms and cabins .
i did n't see roger ; bree was standing by the fire , absorbed in conversation with the bugs , the elderly couple jamie had engaged to help care for the farm .
he owned a farm and a small mill , both at least two days ' ride from the ridge ; not a journey he would undertake simply for the pleasure of our company .
` ` ... ready to ride and spread the alarm , '' i said , half under my breath , ` ` to every middlesex village and farm . ''
` ` it has villages and farms - and the farms are n't all that far from the villages .
` ` it has villages and farms - and the farms are n't all that far from the villages .
the boy had run away from the farm following this incident , which took place two years before .
i inquired of his back , swaying in the saddle as we turned into the thin copse that lay between us and the now - invisible farm .
it was early , but not so early that farm people would not already be about their chores ; i had seen someone earlier , after all .
people did n't normally go off and leave their farms untended , not if they had livestock .
there were no near neighbors to look in , no one else on the farm to safeguard him .
i rather thought he was happy to leave the farm behind , too .
mr . bug was there to tend the farm and livestock and repel physical threats ; mr . wemyss was there to chop firewood , haul water , and generally maintain the fabric of the house .
it was not so much a ledger , she saw , as a logbook , recording the daily activities of the farm .
we had brought large forage nets of dry hay from the beardsley farm ; he opened one of these and scattered feed for the horses and goats , then returned to me .
there 's a decent farm left , though , and a good bit in trade goods there - to say nothing of the goats . ''
isolated as the beardsleys ' farm had been , i could n't imagine fanny having the opportunity to meet very many men , other than the indians who came to trade .
that was a potential trap that i had n't seen ; the possibility that jamie might be accused of killing beardsley in order to get his hands on the trader 's farm and goods , by then adopting the orphan .
he 'd spent all day today helping to ready the farm for their departure , and fragmented images of the round of chores scrolled behind his closed lids whenever he shut his eyes .
i told tryon that we must go , to tend our crops and farms .
the wemyss land adjoined the mcgillivrays ' section , and the two together would make a very respectable farm .
they 'd live at the farm . ''
seeing him look round wide - eyed as we rode through the thick , insect - buzzing forest , fording streams and finding faint deer paths through the thickets , i realized that he had never been anywhere in his life , save the area near the beardsley farm , and fraser 's ridge .
and there 's no farm in thirty miles where they might have come from . ''
he patted the dirk that lay on the corner of his desk , and went back to making lists of farm supplies .
now , with ira 's farm falling on his shoulders , he wished he had .
he wants me to take over his farm . ''
last time jack had seen him out at the farm , two or three years ago , the old man had been so crippled up with rheumatism he could hardly put his work boots on .
now he was a thin feeble old man lying in a hospital bed , worried sick about his pack of mangy dogs back at the farm .
not until he got himself fixed up at the farm .
she 'd helped ella searle with her first - grade class field trip out to sanchez 's pumpkin farm yesterday and had come home with two for herself , one of which already sat in her living - room window grinning at passersby on the street below .
i did n't mention it , but i ' ve given up prospecting and i ' m taking over my uncle 's farm .
ira chesley lived near the longquists on the gallant farm .
at least with part of the farm .
` ` yeah , i made my mind up when i decided to take over the farm that it 's time i got married . ''
you get yourself a wife , now you got a farm and some prospects .
i went out to alberta and got the farm going and one thing and another , and by the time i went back to fetch gladys , back in maple creek , it was too late .
erik wrote he was n't much to look at , had never been married , and owned a farm that was on its way to being prosperous .
she told erik from the beginning of their correspondence he 'd have to teach her about his farm and livestock .
` ` i thought we could get married , have lunch , and then head out to the farm .
i got so busy building the farm after my parents died , i kept putting off finding someone to court .
` ` do you think ... if it is n't ... what i ... '' aundy stammered , trying to figure out a way to ask if she could take a bath when they reached his farm .
` ` you can do that while i take care of the evening chores after i show you around the farm .
she and her husband and son live on the farm to the south of us .
ol ' marvin tooley lives on the farm to the west but he 's cantankerous on a good day , so stay away from him if you can . ''
does he work on your farm ? ''
` ` garrett nash , '' aundy repeated , remembering erik pointing out the nash farm about a half - mile down the road .
by the time she reached the turnoff to the nash farm , her lungs burned and she was convinced she 'd accumulated so much mud on her shoes and clothes , it added an extra twenty pounds of weight .
cradling her left arm against her chest with her right , aundy continued her prayers on erik 's behalf as jim urged the wagon toward erik 's farm .
not too many farm wives have indoor plumbing , but erik wanted to make sure you had every convenience he could provide .
` ` i was hoping to eventually bring ilsa out here to live on the farm .
tom was already taking the doctor 's buggy and horse to erik 's barn for a little feed and rest after the trip out to the farm .
tired of sitting around the house , wondering what to do , she was ready to move forward as the owner of erik 's farm .
it was no secret to her people were wondering what she planned to do with the farm .
relieved the farm was doing well and there was money in the bank , aundy knew if she lived frugally , even if she never made another penny in income , she 'd survive .
knowing how hard erik worked to make his farm prosperous , though , aundy was n't content to sit by and do nothing .
for the farm ? ''
we 're shorthanded without him as it is and we really need to hire some help if you 're of a mind to keep the farm going . ''
he could run the farm with his eyes closed , but there were some young bucks on the payroll who did n't like the notion of a woman being in charge .
` ` i have no intention of selling the farm , dent .
absorbing a chapter at a time , she was feeling a little more confident in her abilities to be a help on the farm .
he 'd wait until after supper tonight to let the guys know aundy was keeping the farm and staying .
` ` did erik have a name for his farm ? ''
everyone round these parts refers to it as the erickson farm .
` ` have you decided what you want to do with the farm yet ? ''
` ` i want to learn all i can about managing a farm .
erik always hired some seasonal help once the farm work began , '' j.b . said , still waiting for garrett to recover from his choking fit and join the conversation .
` ` do the hands know you 're planning to keep the farm and run it yourself ? ''
we 'll all help you learn about farm life .
the firelight in the room was making her hair glimmer and shine and the look on her face , filled with animation and excitement as she talked about learning to farm , made him want to promise to do everything in his power to help her succeed .
` ` most people would have told me to sell the farm , get on a train and return to the city life i know .
after her tour around the farm with dent the previous afternoon , she was confident she could at least feed the chickens and gather eggs .
chicken stew would have tasted good , '' aundy said , thinking she and napoleon needed to reach a compromise or one of them was going to have to leave the farm and it would n't be her .
he did n't get a chance to talk to them about aundy keeping the farm the previous evening , but if he was a betting man , he 'd bet after breakfast they 'd be short a few more hands .
` ` you might as well all know , i spoke with mrs . erikson yesterday and she intends to not only keep the farm but be in control of it . ''
aundy was going to have to hire more men if they hoped to make it through spring calving and farm work .
` ` i told the men you 're planning to run the farm and four of them quit this morning , '' dent said , hoping aundy did n't take it personally .
the hands would have quit if any woman had taken over the farm .
exiting the room , she shut the door quietly behind her and walked back to his desk in the front room where she placed money in four envelopes , addressing each to the appropriate farm hand .
i appreciate the work you ' ve done here on the farm and wish you all much success in your future endeavors . ''
` ` four of the men quit this morning when dent told them i was keeping the farm .
finishing their shopping , they placed aundy 's ad in the paper and left word with a few of the businesses in town they were hiring out at the erickson farm .
up and quit when they found out she 's keeping the farm and staying .
she was a good cook , could maintain order in a home , and perform all the duties flawlessly , but now that she had a farm of her own , she knew without a doubt she 'd much rather be outside than in the house .
aundy sank down on a kitchen chair , wondering what she was going to do about her farm , her lack of employees , and her feelings for handsome garrett nash .
live over yonder , '' the man said as he stabbed his finger in the direction of the farm both garrett and erik had mentioned .
the only reason you ask is that you want my farm .
` ` i 'll say this once and you can tell it to whomever you like , but my farm is n't for sale .
` ` i did n't intend to make an enemy , but i 'd die before i married someone like marvin tooley and there is no way i ' m letting him get his hands on erik 's farm , '' aundy said , feeling her anger stir again at the thought of what marvin tooley suggested .
aundy had been able to use her arm enough to do a few things , like baking recently , which had endeared her to the hands who had n't abandoned her and the farm .
her treats had gone a long way in soothing any ruffled feathers that a woman had taken over the farm .
garrett would rent the one that borders their farm .
she knew from his letters how proud he was of his herd , but she needed to save the farm and if selling the cattle would accomplish it , then so be it .
due to her gender , she 'd gotten the farm into an unexpected bind .
they were far behind on the farm work because the hands had been taking care of the cows as they calved .
she loved the farm , the rolling fields that would soon be bursting with wheat , the green pastures , and the open sky .
as soon as she brought her sister to the farm , aundy decided gathering eggs would become ilsa 's responsibility .
with her dislike of noise , dust and smells , life on the farm was going to be an even bigger adjustment for her than it was for aundy .
` ` what people view as perfect back in the big city might not be as perfect out here on a farm .
` ` dent and i discussed it earlier this afternoon and we agree it 's what needs done if we 're going to keep the farm .
i appreciate that , '' aundy said , looking over the farm from their vantage point on top of the hill behind the barn .
` ` i 'll look forward to seeing you at the farm tomorrow , mr . anderson .
dent sent their hands along to help until they got past the neighboring farms .
` ` erik would be proud that you made a good decision and are doing what you can to keep the farm going .
the payment from the cattle was a boon , but aundy felt driven to make the farm prosperous , like it would have been under erik 's direction .
she had n't seen any sheep on nearby farms and tried to remember what she read about them in the books j.b . had given her .
an idea she thought would bring in a good profit for the farm with a minimal amount of additional work was simmering in her head , but finding someone who would do business with a woman was proving difficult .
` ` animals , '' aundy said , and proceeded to ask j.b . about every type of farm animal she could think of , including sheep .
young , old , poor , rich , handsome , and filthy - she 'd seen just about every type of man come calling in an effort to gain access to erik 's farm .
if his mother had dresses more suited to a farm wife than the city clothes she 'd been wearing , aundy would alter them as well .
the fine fabric was n't made for farm work .
returning to the other bedroom , she sorted through mrs . erickson 's clothing , finding several calico dresses that would be much better suited to wearing on the farm than aundy 's current wardrobe .
when she was satisfied with the information , she took out her pencil and piece of paper and wrote down her name , instructing mr . o'connell to give mrs . erickson a call monday morning or to stop by her farm to discuss the details .
in turn , aundy wrote down his last name and the approximate location of his farm , in case the half - drunk man lost the piece of paper before he got in touch with her .
` ` fine , '' he said , pointing a hand down the road toward the erickson farm .
if i ' m going to run this farm , i need to learn to be self - sufficient . ''
giving in to her emotions , as jumbled as they were , was not going to help prove she could care for herself and erik 's farm .
garrett asked , trying to think of anything aundy would have purchased in the underground that could possibly be beneficial to the farm .
she lives on the next farm over , '' nora said , making introductions .
` ` we 'll be at the farm tomorrow afternoon with your woolies , mrs . erickson .
i hope the sheep will be a good addition to our farm , '' aundy said , catching garrett rolling his eyes .
he might have a thing or two to say about a flock of sheep descending on the farm .
then again , it was her farm and she could do whatever she wanted , whether garrett liked it or not .
` ` i purchased something that i think will add to the value of the farm and provide additional income without increasing the work load by much . ''
i need all of you here on the farm .
for now , though , we have a farm that needs care and are short on people willing to work for a woman .
if she wanted men to treat her like the owner of a farm , then she 'd swallow back her emotions and act like one .
it billowed around her , but she decided with an apron over the top of the dress , it would serve well to wear on the farm .
` ` when we were passing by a farm this morning with the sheep , a huge dog ran out and killed one of the ewes before we could stop him .
` ` our farm is the next one over , nash 's folly .
there are a lot of sheep farms around jordan valley and many of them hired basque shepherds to care for the sheep . ''
they stink , they 'll bring diseases to our farms , and they ai n't nothin ' but a nuisance .
she did n't want to be tied to the kitchen and it was going to be impossible to learn to manage the farm if she was the one who was making two big meals a day for the men .
deciding to place an ad for a cook in the newspaper , since her other advertisement was for farm hands , she hoped someone would respond to it .
at least until aundy learned what she needed to know to successfully manage the farm .
he hated seeing the plain dresses she tended to wear around the farm .
busy with so much work on the farm , aundy did n't really want to make time to go to ashton 's , especially when he did behave somewhat arrogantly if he had an audience .
loving the clean air , the quiet peacefulness of the country , and the freedom she felt on the farm , she was so thankful to be there .
she 'd never been to mr . tooley 's farm , but had an idea where to find it from everyone warning her to stay away .
` ` he showed up at the farm drunk ? ''
` ` git rid a them sheep or git of the farm , ya dum wuman ! ''
she had every right to raise whatever she wanted on the farm and if he had anything to say about it , she 'd never leave .
maybe it was n't so much about the sheep but about her , a woman , taking over the farm .
as the owner of the farm and the sheep , she would n't allow herself the luxury of giving in to the urge to cry until she drained the well dry .
adamant she was n't going to abandon the farm , the sheep , or her men , aundy refused .
pressed against him with his lips moving insistently against hers , she could easily forget about the farm , the sheep , and everything else .
` ` anytime you need me , i 'll be here , '' he said , settling his hat on his thick hair and disappearing into the evening darkness enveloping the farm .
chapter sixteen exhausted after answering endless inquiries about what happened at the farm following church services , aundy declined nora 's offer to stay for lunch and instead went home to spend the afternoon in the peace and quiet of her own house .
he 'd grown a lot in the weeks since he came to the farm .
for now , she was glad to have the gangly boy with her on the farm .
feeling much better than she had when she left the house , she stopped at the creek that ran through the back section of the farm and let bell get a drink .
just before she topped the rise above the back of the home place , she stopped to take in the sight of the farm .
falling into bed exhausted , sleep was a long time coming as she thought about her farm , her family , her duties , and her love for garrett .
there has to be something he wants real bad on the farm .
too bright and lively to stay in the house and be completely domestic , she wanted to be outside doing , learning , succeeding on the farm .
` ` rest while you can , dear mrs . erickson , because as soon as the preacher arrives , you 're marrying me , signing over the farm , then you 're going to tragically fall down the stairs and break your lovely long neck , '' ashton said , patting aundy on the leg as he strode from the room .
his landmarks drew me to the creek that runs through the erickson farm and nash 's folly . ''
at the very least , should n't i have awakened in a laboratory , strapped to a table , with evil scientists doing things to my body they would n't do to farm animals ?

he rams his arms into his red satin coat and then trots out toward the wide hall that leads to the ring , and an entire farm full of animals awaken in my stomach , not just the butterflies .
