clarence took another deep breath and opened his eyes , but he did nt see the desert landscape around him .
her eyes roamed the spare landscape behind the wagon .
clusters of dots speckled the landscape as far as the eye could see .
a bloom of green lightened the landscape .
she smiled down at the landscape .
alma gazed across the landscape into the distant horizon .
the cool of night had already passed , and the warmth of the day settled over the landscape .
in the sudden silence , a gun shot rang out across the landscape .
luke rides silently , looking at the landscape .
parkman was still where he had been , a distant dark dot on the rolling green landscape of the kansas plains .
three days had passed since that first night and the landscape had changed .
atop that small hill , dad gazed out and he panned the landscape .
he took a deep breath , gazing out at the dark landscape .

both spent hours staring out of the window as the landscape transformed .
she saw the landscape was losing its definition , the far hills blurring into a single smudge of purple - tinged dark , and wondered when it had begun to dim .
then the hills of rome began to heave , swelling up , and gradually spreading , like a blot of blood , over the whole landscape .
from here on the palatine they could see the whole of rome spread out below the massive twinned peak of the capitol ; the scattered houses on the hills , the tiber silvered with sunlight , the gold and green of a young spring landscape .
the green landscape turned suddenly black as clouds choked off the sunlight , the silver tiber dulled to a smear of grey .
tarquinius had n't noticed the pools earlier , but now the sun was catching the water , silvering it so it stood out bright against the misty landscape .
he thought back to the view of the landscape from the top of the dune ; there was a little ridge about ten degrees east of north , where the land rose .
suddenly , the white stood out vivid against the dreary landscape of saltmarsh and dunes , confusing the eye into seeing a shimmering level plane of light hovering above the ground .
it was a nice decision whether to have men making the mats in advance , or get the digging under way ; in the end , he looked at the huge sky and the bleak landscape and thought it might be best to dig while the weather lasted .
each clump of grass , each dune , each mazy channel of brackish water , as soon as you walked past it began to recede into an undifferentiated flatness and bleakness ; you could lose yourself here so easily , without those white markers and the ropes with which he 'd bound the landscape .
he saw each movement of the drill now redolent with new meaning , as if he 'd looked down on a dead landscape and suddenly the sun had shone from behind a cloud , filling it with highlights ; when he stepped forwards now with a spear , he saw in his mind 's eye the whole phalanx pushing on against a bridgehead ; when he stepped back , an orderly retreat .
as the romans reached the top of the ridge , the view opened up below ; the river gleaming like metal as the early sun caught it , the landscape around it blurred as if with mist , and still monochrome , the indistinct shapes of trees and hedges without depth in deeper or lighter grey , the hills sagging behind in sad brown ; only far in the distance had the sun caught the snowline of the further mountains .
the tolerances were fine , the plan had to be nicely judged ; besides falling just the right amount , at the right gradient , the channels had to be planned to follow the contours , to clear every stagnant pond and marshy dip ; and that was not so easy , the geometry of the meandering channels would turn back on itself if you were n't careful , or you 'd end up leaving a morass in some crease of the landscape undrained .
it was a strange gift , this ability to coax the landscape into comformity with human desire ; it was not pure engineering - you had to be able to look at the landscape as if through half - closed eyes , letting its lineaments sink in , and then superimpose on that the changes you wanted to make .

so though all etruscan temples shared an orientation , between north and east , in the fortunate quadrant of the heavens , none faced exactly one compass point ; and though etruscan towns shared the same plan of two crossing main streets , they adjusted it to the landscape - staties long and thin on its sharp ridge , curtun with its sprawling x and roughly squared circle of walls , the sinuous streets of velathri .
he might as well have taken that decision on the stone facings sitting in his palace as down here ; he 'd have had a better view of the marshes from up on the palatine , too , without the strange foldings and blurrings of the landscape that disorientated you at ground level .
the world had come into being with its gods ; they formed its landscape , its caves and promontories and sinkholes and rivers every one of them the home of a god , or rather , the god 's integument , like a snake 's sloughed skin .
you have no idea , egerius , what greece is like ; here , the landscape is on a human scale , but our plains are scoured by the wind , bleached by the sun .
they 'd got into rough country where every valley turned into a ravine , where ravines led them up to nearly impassable walls of rock , where velzna 's immense rock seemed to have been swallowed up in the wallowing humps of the landscape , and haze obscured the distance , and at times only the sun kept them heading northwards .
quintus whistling not quite noiselessly between his teeth ; postumus looking round the landscape , eyes on the skyline .
where there had once been scattered shepherds ' huts and straggling , wandering paths , streets like sword slashes now divided the city neatly , as if writing an alphabet across the landscape .
the smell of her , the feel of her , the taste of tullia ; she filled his senses , so that the landscape passed without his noticing .
they walked along the line that had been laid out ; in one place the banks had already been thrown up to their full height , the soil a raw scar on the landscape , but for most of its length only a low mound ran alongside the beginnings of the ditch , and towards the little spur of the viminal hill and the long sloping table of the esquiline there was only a line of rope slung from roughly hammered - in stakes .
the landscape was unreadable ; what looked like a stump of a bush might be the altar of a tomb , a dab of dirty white was a rock until it moved , a trail of dark might be a stream or a path or a shadow .
the landscape of mystery was becoming a trivial , everyday wasteland ; deep night waited to be brutalised and cheapened by the day .
it 's odd how quiet spreads , like when a cloud drifts across the sun and the darkness moves across the landscape , hills that a moment ago blazed with gorse and light turning grey and lifeless .
it was hazy , but i could pick out the road : a long brown - black scar on the landscape , coming out of the fort and heading west , joining , it seemed , another road that ran straight as an arrow from north to south .
a few hours later , the sun started to peak over the horizon , unveiling the majestic beauty of a rolling landscape gently embraced by the soft snow .
it was hard to leave the prospect of spending more time in the luxury of the tuscan highlands , surrounded by the beauty of that rolling landscape and the enchanting shyness of don alexandros daughter .
the scars of the war were evident all across the landscape .
the moon was not full , like in her dream , but its waning light still lit the landscape with a silvery radiance .
the earth and timber castle sat in the heart of the aberdeenshire countryside , its large circular motte rising up impressively before them , forming an excellent vantage point from which to admire the beautiful green landscape but also , and more importantly , to spot approaching enemies .
he slowly went over the landscape with his field glasses and kept his eyes busy looking for any movement across the river .

she and her principle minions trekked the north american landscape , searching for a retreat where no one could find them unless they wanted to be found .
uncontrolled and unfought fires dot the landscape , a heavy smoke drifts through the air like fog .
when i was sure that there were no more stragglers is when i finally focused on the landscape around me .
it was in the direct path of the massive horde that swept through , and all around the landscape was a shambles .
