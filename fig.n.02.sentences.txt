finally , he snuck inside the estate wallshed earlier learned that an - khi had dismissed the guards after paser diedpast the fig trees and sycamores to the forecourt under the palm tree .
as though i give a fig for such a thing .

in the street you might see men wearing fine etruscan linens , sky blue or poppy red , as well as the undyed wool of old rome ; sometimes , the sound of a flute drifted across the open land near the founder 's fig tree .
but they still cast a gloomy pall on the occasion ; some of the children hissed them , but their parents passed by trying to avoid their glance , and some made the sign of the fig with their fingers to avert the ill fate they represented .
tarquinius , tyrant of rome , was not what he 'd sought to become , but he had grown into the name as a fig tree grows into a crevice , and ends up twisted .
she deliberately did not look away , not to the sides , not down , but kept her open smile fixed , looking fabia in the eyes , as if she 'd been offered a third cup of wine or a recipe for fig jam .
he knew there was a fig tree , not far away from the house , that grew bushy and thick ; he 'd hide himself there .

dna did nt mean a fig to meister .
` ` i do n't care a fig for the river . ''
` ` strangler fig , '' i said .
there was more strangler fig growing out of the masses of seagrape and rhododendron .
my hip snarled as we thumped back over the strangler fig roots burrowing under the road .
the last twenty - five yards of the shell drive had been buried in strangler fig .
xii we had reached the point where the driveway began to be overgrown with strangler fig when i saw that black thing go flickering through the high tangle of weeds to the right of the house .
nor did he stir the thick mat of strangler fig springing up all around him .
after much study of the pictures in the booklet ( which were labelled figs , as in fig 1 , fig 2 , and so on ) and enough practice in derry park to lame his arm , he had gotten so he could hit the paper target which had also come with the slingshot maybe three times out of every ten tries .

do you think anyone cares a fig about your bun anymore , you silly goose ?
wilma cared not a fig for football - baseball , basketball , or hockey , either , as far as that went .
he did n't care much for the caviar - it tasted like cold fish jelly - but bateman also had a pepperoni , a salami , two tins of sardines , some slightly mushy apples , and a large box of keebler fig bars .
wonderful for the bowels , fig bars , bateman said .
she sat in the shade of their pepper tree and ate a few fig bars .
he did n't care a fig for the windy city .
most everyone who 's on a trip keeps a few munchies in their car , oreos or fig newtons or something like that . ''
the stars from the sky fell to the earth , like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind .
with the bureaucratic slowness of last will and testament executors , often complicated by legal challenges by disgruntled heirs , the neglect of time meant many of these colonial manors now sport awesome jungle - like vines , long and tangled bougainvillea creepers , fin - rooted fig trees and spreading banyans with low - hanging , fibrous beards .
then the reading room of the public library beneath a quarto - sized book ( serving as his fig leaf ) , when a prissy but curvaceous librarian , between checking out books and answering membership queries , kept returning to stacking the shelves right in front of him .
on your doorstep , cloth head sausages fully abandoned , arnold dunked a fig roll .
stopping inside the entrance gates , he surveyed the path winding through the rolling expanse of lawn , garden and gigantic moreton bay fig trees .
in the week since he d found the run - down flat on a little dead - end street at west end , he d walked down to the park every afternoon to sit in the coolness of the moreton bay figs and watch the day fade into dusk .
says fig .
lets see if i can save this with ... fig .
nev eased the car into a space down the block from the junes house , and the two of them climbed the eight brick steps that had fig vine on the risers .
cast adrift for the evening , she stood at the top of the nine fig vine covered brick steps , wondering how and where to placate her desire for a sidecar on the rocks .
helstof said , fig leaf .
a fig leaf is too much ?
now , how do you design a fig leaf costume that is both aesthetically pleasing and fully functional ?
they shooed the two guys away from the tables and got down to drawing fig leaves , and discussing how to do the fittings on bart .
roger and the whosey were particularly distracted , sitting next to each other and wondering when , where , and how gale and helstof were going to do their costume fitting of the fig leaf on big bart , the guy who could throw women up in the air with one arm , them achieving a suborbital state of weightlessness at the zenith of the trajectory .
big bart , thong and fig leaf .
well , we have some fig leaf designs done .
she looked at selgey , said , they need bart to try on the fig leaves , the different ones , see if they work or not .
they were thongs with , well , fig leaves .
