` ` cream and one sugar , right ? ''
` ` that 's what a sugar daddy will get you , '' bradley stage whispers .
` ` here , '' rais said and handed her some sugar cubes .

` ` so tell me about this new boyfriend of yours , '' she said , adding cream and sugar to her coffee .
she held the grimace at the dark liquid , too embarrassed to put cream or sugar into her coffee .
she reached out and poured herself a cup almost half full with coffee , then the rest she filled with cream , uncaring this time if he considered her coffee simply a cream and sugar transport mechanism .
she asked as she scooped two large spoonfuls of sugar into the delicate bone china .
she turned away and headed into the pantry for sugar to make the frosting .
she really had to assert herself , she thought as she carried the powdered sugar and milk back to the counter .
she released the breath she had n't realized she 'd been holding and gripped the sugar more tightly .
` ` half a cup of coffee and the rest cream and sugar , right ? ''
he tasted of chocolate and sugar , she thought , eagerly raising her mouth to his .
` ` i ' m terribly sorry about yesterday , tabby , '' he said , handing her the sugar for her tea .
` ` louis will get it , '' he countered and a man in a white uniform appeared as if by magic and poured her coffee , putting in lots of cream and sugar , just as she liked it .
` ` you can get milk and sugar over there , '' he told her but moved off to one of the tables that had just been vacated .
she grabbed two napkins and poured milk and sugar into her coffee , then followed him to the table .
and lots of sugar , '' he explained , winking when she blushed .
she was so relaxed from the fried food and sugar , not to mention the two beers she 'd enjoyed during their lunch time argument , plus the exercise , the sunshine and the lack of sleep over the past several days .
she was too filled with food , sugar and beer to be angry .
there was n't much to use unless she could figure out how to build a weapon from flour or sugar .
she poured flour into one of the stainless steel mixing bowls , sugar into another , and placed several bottles nearby .
` ` come on , sugar , let 's try the soup n ' salad today ; i ' m not in the mood for diner food . ''
` ` sugar , that 's enough .
she needed sugar for her coffee , but she considered dumping the black liquid into the sink or doing without sweetener , desperate to get away from the room so she did n't have to hear more of the disgusting conversation .
reaching behind the two men , she quickly poured some sugar into her cup and rushed out of the room , ignoring the spilled sugar crystals as well as their lewd comments about the women they had been with the previous night while their wives were home with their young children .

after being outside in the cold for hours , the warmth soothed me from the inside , and i savored the flavor of coffee , sugar , and whipped cream , reminding me that i was still alive and living .

he was covered in blue sugar and his mom just smiled , not seeming to care that he was a giant mess .
i briefly hoped it was my hot new neighbor from three doors down needing to borrow a cup of sugar , but knowing my luck , it would probably be a punk - ass kid playing ding - dong ditch .
that man can cook , but when he gets near sugar , bad things happen .
` ` well , good morning , sugar .
` ` oh my gawd , mr . finnegan , it 's so good to see you again , '' i mocked , adding extra southern sugar to my voice to mimic darla 's sweet drawl .
i , on the other hand , poured in a hefty amount of cream and dumped in three spoonfuls of sugar before bringing the cup to my lips .
he poured me a cup of coffee , and i watched him dump creamer and a heaping pile of sugar into his own cup .

` ` would you like some sugar , sir ? ''
i eagerly added some to my coffee and poured some sugar in as well .
i hurried into the restaurant and took a deep breath , inhaling the soothing scent of baking sugar and butter .
charlotte handed me a full cup of coffee in a plain blue cup , pointing to the kitchen table where a pitcher of real cream and a sugar bowl sat waiting .
i grinned and headed over to make my mug more cream and sugar than coffee .
` ` now , if you 'll excuse me , mr . belrose , '' i continued , still smiling and forcing sugar sweet niceness from every pore , ` ` i need to get to work . ''
` ` he also likes two sugars and no cream in his coffee . ''
but some caffeine and mocha sugar sounded like comfort food and i needed some comfort .
she stirred a cube of sugar into her turkish coffee , seeming distracted by something .
to the left , however , she could see a path that must lead down to a white sugar sand beach about one hundred feet below .
sophia 's hand shook as she stirred some sugar into her coffee .
frustrated beyond words with her mother 's persistence , by the time callie had ended the phone call , she 'd already measured the ingredients for several dozen sugar cookies and had pulled the box of oats from the cupboard for a double batch of chocolate - chip - oatmeal cookies .
as she measured cocoa and flour , something she 'd heard on a cooking show came to mind and caused her to knock over a cup of sugar .

some people put cream and sugar on them , others even put maple syrup or cheese .
she sipped the coffee gratefully and was amazed to find that there was adequate sugar in it .

it was unfortunate that she 'd been up since five o'clock that morning and she 'd only had sugar for dinner .
because the long hours and stress of the day , the slow movements of the actors , plus the sugar low from her ` ` dinner '' crashed in on her at the same time .
he handed her an apple and a carrot , then stuck several sugar cubes into her pocket .
his statement did n't help her figure out what he was about but she knew from reading that horses liked apples , carrots and sugar so she guessed that they were for the horses but as bribes ?
` ` give her the sugar cubes that you have hidden in your pocket .
she knows they are there and you 'll have a friend for life , '' he explained and held the horse 's mouth away long enough for tara to retrieve the sugar cubes .
she loves sugar and will only lick them off your hand .
are you going to give that sugar to lady ?
` ` no problem there , '' she muttered but she was n't going to admit that the horse named ' lady ' was definitely a sweet and gentle animal and her tongue did tickle tara 's palm as the horse licked the sugar crystals off .

he glanced over his shoulder , surprised , then got back to work , steeping the tea bag in the water and adding her one teaspoon of sugar before rejoining her at the table .
` ` well , i 'd love a large coffee with milk and sugar and one of those delicious - looking blueberry muffins . ''
the sugar helped with the heartache and the remnants of the hangover , but i still did n't know what to do .
i looked at my haul and i did n't even want to begin to figure out how many calories and grams of sugar were in this one basket .
` ` cookies have lots sugar .
if you eat too much the sugar monster will come and nibble on your toes while you 're sleeping . ''
` ` god , i hope that bit about the sugar monster does n't send them to therapy when they 're older .
cream and sugar .
` ` cream and sugar ? ''
he 'd already put out the cream and sugar for me .
i find myself in need of a sugar boost . ''
three , drown sorrows in oj and wait for sugar seizures . ''
some of the sugar is missing this time .
you tell me where to go and i 'll simply show up to pay , sugar , cream , stir , and sip .
are they fresh or frozen if they 're all fat and juicy and kind of pop a little in your mouth ... oh and taste like they have sugar inside ? ''
` ` all right , sugar britches .
` ` i ' m not the one on the ground , sugar . ''
` ` i swear , there are no strings , sugar .
` ` this is n't going to be fast , sugar , '' he murmurs as his lips drift down my jawline .
` ` we had a rough year , sugar .
` ` i ' m fine , sugar . ''
` ` you really need to think about whether or not you want to be involved with me and all of my baggage , sugar .
` ` we are going to take this one day at a time , sugar .
` ` let 's go before i carry you upstairs , sugar . ''
` ` i know how i 'd like to hold on to you , sugar . ''
i like to make sugar cookies at christmastime . ''
i pour us all a cup of coffee , set cream and sugar on the table , and we dig into the brownies without plates or forks .
i ' m sorry i did n't respond to your texts , sugar . ''
` ` i fucking love them , sugar .
` ` do n't think i ' m not onto your game , sugar . ''
` ` that 's right , sugar .
` ` hey , sugar . ''
we 'll start with the sugar cookies , then the chocolate chip , peanut butter , and we 'll do the chex mix last . ''
` ` i already made the sugar cookie dough because it had to set up in the fridge for a couple hours before we can roll it out . ''
` ` okay , sugar cookies are done .
seth laughs and helps her clean up the sugar cookie mess on the table and all i can do is watch silently .
his lips twitch as he fights his smile and he ducks his head , measuring the sugar like jill showed him .
jill frowns as she watches seth mix the eggs and sugar in the bowl .
` ` i ' m sorry , did you say something , sugar ? ''
she pulls the sugar cookies out of the oven and sets them on a rack to cool as we replace them with a batch of chocolate chip cookies .
` ` we are having a blast , sugar . ''
` ` we have to frost the sugar cookies , '' jill announces halfway into the movie , then glances down and laughs .
` ` why have you been crying , sugar ? ''
i pick up a green - frosted sugar cookie and take a bite .
` ` i ' m going to do a lot of naughty things to you in that hotel room tonight , sugar . ''
` ` excuse me , sugar , '' i whisper into jill 's ear .
` ` it was a motherfucker of a day , sugar .
` ` i think i should remind you who you belong to , sugar . ''
` ` do you know how gorgeous your pussy is , sugar ? ''
` ` dragging against your sweet spot , sugar ? ''
` ` good morning , sugar , '' he whispers against my ear .
` ` you know what i love about your body , sugar ? ''
zack glances down at me and leans in to whisper in my ear , ` ` you 'll be sleeping in my bed , sugar . ''
` ` you 'll see , sugar . ''
` ` i always have a great time with you , sugar .
` ` be right back , sugar . ''
` ` we have dozens of thermoses , sugar . ''
thor is lying in a sugar coma on a blanket in the snow and seth is leaning against him , looking at his phone .
` ` i ' m sorry , sugar . ''
` ` there 's nothing for you to help with , sugar .
` ` you did n't have to get me anything , sugar . ''
` ` hey , it 's okay , sugar .
` ` hey , sugar , '' he says as he answers .
` ` bye , sugar . ''
` ` i ' m in a tie , sugar .
` ` i love you , sugar . ''
` ` you are the most amazing person i ' ve ever met , sugar . ''
congratulations , sugar . ''
` ` hey sugar , '' he says as he opens my door for me and gives me a big hug before following me to the door and inside the house .
` ` i ' m sorry for the way i reacted yesterday , sugar .
` ` life is about so much more than surviving , sugar . ''
` ` i 'll be right behind you , sugar . ''
` ` aw , sugar , please do n't cry .
` ` talk to me , sugar . ''
` ` you are going to be an awesome mom , sugar . ''
` ` god , i missed you too , sugar , '' i growl .
you were carrying precious cargo , sugar , '' zack says and kisses my head as he looks at the photos over my shoulder .
` ` i love you , sugar , '' zack whispers in my ear as i gaze lovingly around the room at our big , beautiful family , that continues to grow at an alarming rate .
i got the biggest mug i could find , filled it with a shitload of half - and - half and sugar , and a moderate amount of coffee .
i busied myself with doctoring it with sugar and cream .
` ` i put half cream and three spoonfuls of sugar , '' he said with a shrug , ` ` you set up the coffee yourself .
she handed me a mug of coffee and pointed toward the table where the cream and sugar were sitting .
i started doctoring my coffee with sugar and cream .
` ` treats everywhere , '' i said , snagging a sugar biscuit in the shape of a bird and popping it in my mouth .
robbie 's wife , ellen , had made the prettiest spread for them , iced cupcakes and strawberries , and tea , of course , with milk and sugar .
` ` you sure about that , sugar ?
` ` got ta be more specific than that , sugar . ''
` ` sure did , sugar . ''
then we were on the road again , and i was about to drool from the incredible aroma of dough and sugar .
` ` hi , sugar , '' i said .
` ` hold that thought , sugar .
` ` sorry , sugar , '' i said .
i devoured a donut , then licked the sugar off my fingers .
` ` bless her little heart , '' my mother says , in a tone that practically drips sugar , ` ` but my nichole is n't a girl who can eat cake and then get into something as form - fitting as a wedding gown . ''
as if damien stark with a sugar high was the way we wanted to go .
` ` you have me at a disadvantage , sugar , '' i say , with my brightest smile and my thickest texas drawl .
` ` sugar , i think you have us confused .
i ' m still buzzing from sugar and conversation when evelyn heads back to malibu and i return to my office .
inside are a dozen sugar cookies baked in the shape of dog bones .
and powdered sugar .
i grabbed the butter , cinnamon , and powdered sugar , lining them up near her hip , and wrenched her t - shirt over her head without a word .
next came the powdered sugar .
i patted an ample amount of powdered sugar on top , for good measure .
i went sparing on the cinnamon and sugar , as well .
she chose the sweet cream flavor , mixed it with cinnamon and topped it with powdered sugar , shooting me that sweet , wicked smile of hers from time to time .
the sweet spice of the cinnamon , the powdery texture of the sugar , and that sweet creamy flavor that tied it all together .
she added a sugar packet and stirred it .
she shook her head , adding more sugar .
like a bowl of spilled sugar , her body crystallized and flew in ninety different directions .
toasted bagels slathered with a thick layer of cream cheese , a thermal carafe of coffee and a tea service set of mugs , creamer , sugar , and spoons .
he set the tray on the bed , arranged himself near me , poured me my coffee the way i liked it , light sugar , heavy cream .
it was blazing hot , and doctored exactly how i like it , light cream , heavy sugar .
she 'd melt like sugar on his tongue ...
` ` i remembered that you took it practically with equal parts coffee , cream , and sugar as a girl .
ian looked down at the coffee table between them and idly began flipping a sugar packet with his long fingers .
chapter fifteen julia brushed some sugar crystals along the rim of a martini glass , and handed her signature cocktail to a woman in a standard , boring , black business suit who 'd wandered in a few minutes ago rolling a large black case on wheels - the kind that was usually full of pharmaceuticals .
as she mixed up a purple concoction with sugar on the rim , she crooked a finger toward him , signaling for him to lean closer across the bar .
we heard this is the only bar where we can get it made fresh , '' she said , emphasizing that last word like it was made of sweet sugar .
that clear things up for you , sugar ? ''
a line of godivas danced by us with their boy - toys , and i looked up at stefan to see him grinning like a kid in a candy store about to binge on sugar .
nina looked down at the martini glass rimmed with sugar and then looked up at me .
a tiny sugar crystal hung off her bottom lip , so i slid the pad of my thumb across it to clean it off before i licked the sugar from my finger .
a tiny sugar crystal hung off her bottom lip , so i slid the pad of my thumb across it to clean it off before i licked the sugar from my finger .
i 'd skewered some fresh pineapple rolled in sugar to grill as well , a nice accompaniment to the fish .
` ` ashley ... '' ` ` it 's my wedding night , the only one i 'll ever have , should n't i get at least one kiss , please , pretty please with sugar on top ? ''
i click on the link , expecting it to be an open call for showgirls , or a ` ` sugar daddy seeking '' situation .
` ` we have a message for your sugar daddy , '' the bald man says , ` ` from our boss , mr . conti .
stella graciously stirred her sugar in her cappuccino then calmly placed the teaspoon down and took a careful sip .
he 'd rather hurt your feelings instead of sugar coating anything to make you feel better .
we both murmured our thanks before we took a moment to drop sugar cubes and stir the steaming java concoction .
she paused before she plucked one brown sugar cube from the tiny bowl , placing it on the old wooden table and restlessly toying with it as she pondered about the past .
for a few silent minutes , i watched as he busied himself with pouring the coffee , adding cream and sugar before stirring it in slow , casual circles .
` ` does she take milk and sugar ? ''
` ` no milk , no sugar , but do use honey , '' he stated as if he was a robot before resuming his walkabout .
i mean , stop finding sugar daddies . ''
he thinks i have a new sugar daddy .
i poured myself a cup of coffee that smelled faintly of chocolate and almonds and doused it with a healthy dose of sugar and thick cream .
she said he would throw whole bags of them into the exhibit just to watch the bears tear the packages open and gorge on the sugar . ''
` ` sweeter than sugar , '' he grinned .
it 's a thong made out of sugar candy .
firstly , because that would mean i 'd have to leave my sugar haven .
i decided to blame the chocolate and sugar overload for my temporary mental breakdown .
i took a seat across from her at the kitchen island and started shoveling sugar into my coffee .
hating that he was standing there like chiseled perfection while my hair was frizzing by the second and the sugar from my coffee was sticking to my chest .
i took a big bite of pancake and hoped the sugar would somehow satisfy me .
he laughs , rolling down his window to order - two coffees , loaded with cream and sugar , and a chocolate muffin .
` ` about your sugar daddy . ''
` ` first of all , he 's not my sugar daddy , he 's my ... '' ` ` your what ? ''
i use the last little bit of money on my meal card to purchase the largest coffee they have , drowning the bitter liquid with copious amounts of sugar , enough to leave me bouncing off the walls for hours .
` ` ugh , how much sugar is in this thing ? ''
` ` come sit near me sugar and give me your honey . ''
there 's a packet of sugar and a tiny stirring spoon on the saucer .
` ` with cream and sugar .
after adding a splash of milk and a bit of sugar into my coffee , i see drake enter the kitchen .
the sand is warm and sugar soft .
` ` sugar cube , you ' ve got enough baggage to keep him interested for a long time . ''
` ` so , sugar , you fixin ' to show us some fancier shoes for our girl ? ''
since i did n't have anyone around to comfort me , i cracked a pint of haagen - dazs at two a.m. '' ` ` you wallowed in sugar ; i wallowed in pain .
` ` i love shockin ' you , sugar .
` ` well , sugar cube , vincent is my friend .
` ` that 's a shame for you , sugar lips , because i am fun .
these are seven - nut , whole - grain pumpkin muffins sweetened with organic honey and raw sugar . ''
` ` is it wrong to hope one day i 'll see you with powdered sugar all over your face and frosting in your teeth ? ''
our work is n't all that overtly philanthropic of course , do n't think i ' m sugar coating it , but our overall goal is to fix glaring inequalities , to protect people who ca n't protect themselves . ''
he poured me a cup of coffee , adding copious amounts of sugar and cream , just the way i liked it .
do n't worry about sugar coating the past .
we started out wanting to make cookies , and then they had to be heart shaped , and then they had to be pink , so ... '' beth threw her hands up as we surveyed the counter covered in sugar cookie debris .
i struggled to come up with the right words , let alone with pink sugar cookie in my mouth .
` ` you 're sweeter'n ten pounds of sugar .
` ` you 're welcome , sugar . ''
macie heard the spritz spritz of velma 's breath spray and then velma cooed , ` ` howdy there , sugar .
` ` actually , everything would be great if you 'd come over here and give me a little sugar . ''
an underlying hint of apples and caramel and sugar .
` ` oh , marky - mark , you are sweeter than ten pounds of sugar , '' keely cooed .
` ` aw , sugar pie , honey bun , would that be so bad ? ''
` ` when you were growing up , but your daddy and i could n't help it , sugar .
table cleared , coffee poured , the last of the sugar cookies between them , her mother addressed the issue again , just as aj expected she would .
` ` amy jo , will you put out the creamer and sugar ?
skylar stirred sugar substitute in her iced tea .
` ` c'mere and give me some sugar . ''
` ` come give daddy some sugar . ''
aj 's so sweet sugar would n't melt in her mouth . ''
` ` you look just like your mama , doncha , sugar ? ''
he snagged a spoon from the dish rack , passing it and the sugar canister to edgard , ignoring chassie 's questioning stare .
` ` such sweet bullshit , but i 'll take every bit of flattery fallin ' from those sugar lips , sugar . ''
` ` such sweet bullshit , but i 'll take every bit of flattery fallin ' from those sugar lips , sugar . ''
` ` hey , sugar pie .
he wanted a sugar daddy , a citified papi with deep pockets .
the scent of sugar cookies and coffee wafted from the kitchen .
` ` you do n't need extra sugar in your coffee this mornin ' , your mouth is already so damn sweet , so start spillin ' your guts . ''
edgard dumped another spoonful of sugar in his coffee .
ed reached for another packet of sugar on trevor 's side of the table , his voice dropped .
` ` whatcha need , sugar ? ''
` ` i 'll put in a slice of chocolate cake and toss in one of those soft sugar cookies for sweet baby too . ''
domini blurted , ` ` i 'll throw in a couple of sugar cookies for you too , '' and practically sprinted away .
she could n't stand the idea of them hurting alone so she whipped up a batch of sugar cookies and left edgard in charge .
` ` sugar cookies for aunt carolyn . ''
i ' m goin ' crazy- '' ` ` i know , sugar , me too . ''
` ` i sorta like the idea of you playin ' fetch and carry for me , sugar . ''
` ` bein 's that i have n't seen your ni**les , i ' m afraid i ca n't return the compliment , sugar .
` ` yes , sugar , it is . ''
` ` until he hits the sugar crash stage from too much kool - aid . ''
i expected better from you , sugar . ''
` ` no , sugar , you do n't . ''
` ` take a deep breath , sugar , i 'll be there in thirty minutes . ''
` ` no way , eliza , the last thing you need is more sugar . ''
` ` sugar , you know you can tell me anything and i ai n't gon na judge you . ''
` ` oh , sugar .
` ` just ask me the question i see in your eyes , sugar . ''
` ` sugar , have you ever played ? ''
` ` ah hell , sugar , c'mere , '' he managed over the lump in his throat .
` ` sugar , i should ' ve guessed you 'd be a brazilian kind of gal . ''
` ` i do n't mind when you lose to me , sugar . ''
` ` sugar , you have the oddest look .
` ` but that 's the beauty of bettin ' against me , sugar .
mornin ' , sugar . ''
sweet sugar and salty colt .
she sucked off the brown sugar sweetness until all she could taste was the muskiness of colt .
` ` no shame in likin ' it raunchy , sugar , now hold on . ''
` ` colt- '' ` ` loosen up , sugar . ''
` ` only woman i want slavering and trailing after me , all lovesick , is you , sugar . ''
` ` good answer , sugar .
tell me , sugar , what 's one of your unfulfilled fantasies ? ''
` ` sugar , i 'll give you as many kisses as you can handle . ''
` ` only when it comes to you , sugar .
` ` sugar , look at me . ''
is this some kind of sex game , sugar ?
this is the real deal , sugar .
` ` please tell me you 're whipping up goodies full of chocolate and sugar . ''
creaming butter and powdered sugar together released a familiar sugary scent , way better than any expensive aromatherapy .
for dinner she 'd grilled a juicy steak , loaded a baked sweet potato with butter and brown sugar , poured a glass of shiraz and finished off the meal with a slice of chocolate peanut - butter pie .
domini turned up the kettle and gathered her thoughts as she lined up mugs , sugar cubes and milk .
her father 's glower lingered on jack as he passed carolyn another packet of sugar .
` ` i ' m sorry , sugar , what did you say ? ''
` ` come on , sugar , you 're breakin ' my heart here . ''
` ` sugar , you 're babbling . ''
my threats ai n't idle , sugar , so stay put . ''
` ` i have , sugar .
` ` sugar , i ai n't one to cast stones .
he nipped her mouth with firm - lipped sugar bites .
you iced over my coffee with that cold glare , sugar . ''
another thing her father and her son had in common : love of sugar - laden cereals .
` ` ah sugar , you 're playin ' with fire , eyeballin ' me like that . ''
` ` i can live with being a distraction , sugar .
` ` you were testy about me parceling out a taste of my c**k an inch at a time , were n't you , sugar ? ''
in fact , sugar , you 're teeth are startin ' to hurt a little . ''
doctor 's orders are doctor 's orders , sugar .
` ` then sugar , i think it 's long past time you did . ''
` ` oh sugar . ''
` ` you sure you wan na hear my past secrets and lies , sugar ?
` ` i need conditioner- '' ` ` i know sugar .
` ` i can still see to your needs , sugar , '' he said with a silken drawl .
` ` you 're gon na hafta do some of the work , sugar .
` ` it 'll be all kinds of fun poppin ' your pickup cherry , sugar . ''
` ` ah sugar , what am i gon na do with you ?
` ` ginger , sugar , cut yourself some slack .
` ` sugar , i ' m wantin ' you real bad .
he whispered , ` ` go back to sleep , sugar .
well , sugar , i ' m gon na want you to leave 'em off for a bit . ''
` ` look at me while i ' m lovin ' on you , sugar .
` ` kane- '' ` ` come for me , sugar . ''
` ` i 'll give you all the kisses you can handle , sugar . ''
` ` i love you too , sugar .
` ` well , sugar , i 'll be involved every step of the way this time so do n't even think about tryin ' to handle any of this on your own . ''
stop cryin ' , sugar .
but first ... c'mere and give me some sugar . ''
he snapped , ` ` sugar tits , you 'd better have a goddamn good reason for calling me on thanksgiving . ''
chase called his publicist ... sugar tits ?
they 'd gorged themselves on sugar cookies , loaded with colored sprinkles , and warm , chocolatey milk .
` ` which is a shame because i had great plans involving me tasting your sugar plum first thing this morning . ''
` ` oh , sugar , do n't kid yourself for a second he was unwilling . ''
so , sugar , take your desperation to some other man because brandt is not interested in you . ''
whenever you called me- '' ` ` sugar tits ? ''
` ` nothing about you calling me sugar tits is considered remotely respectable , '' she snapped .
` ` yes , you 're sporting a helluva centerfold body , sugar t- '' shit .
` ` sugar , '' he said with a silky rasp , ` ` i ' m an everything man .
the waitress dropped off two glasses of peach iced tea and chase dumped in three packets of sugar .
he ripped open two more packets of sugar and angrily dumped them in his tea , violently stirring the liquid .
` ` that much sugar is n't good for you . ''
` ` tilt your chin up , sugar , '' ava drawled .
` ` oh , i know what you were thinking , sugar tits . ''
` ` you do n't mind if i call you sugar tits , do you ?
` ` same goes , sugar tits . ''
` ` actually , i prefer sugar tits . ''
` ` just for that smartass crack , sugar tits , i ' m gon na eat my fill of you .
` ` aw , sugar , i ' m so sorry . ''
` ` getting me some sugar . ''
` ` getting me some sugar , '' she mimicked his husky drawl and swooped in for a kiss .
` ` i ' m a solid five inches below the six foot benchmark , sugar . ''
i want them sugar tits in my mouth . ''
` ` i think you 're worse , sugar , because you hide it better .
a girl so sweet and demure sugar would n't melt in her mouth .
` ` is there sugar in here ? ''
she stirred a packet of sugar in her tea .
he poured two glasses of tea , setting a sugar canister and a spoon beside hers .
after stirring three spoonfuls of sugar into her tea , she sat in the corner of the couch with her feet tucked under her .
sugar - rimmed glasses , a slice of lemon , pieces of lemongrass twined around a cocktail pick weighted at the bottom with a chunk of amber - colored candied ginger .
vi arranged the extra scraps of dough on a cookie sheet and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on each piece .
i want to help , 'cause , sugar , i think you need it . ''
` ` oh sugar , '' joely said .
'cause sugar , he just walked in the door . ''
fill you with sugary treats and send you home all hyped up on extra sugar . ''
` ` right , sugar bear ? ''
for the second movie she armed herself with a jumbo bucket of popcorn slathered with butter , an extra - large box of sugar babies and a caffeine - free soda .
you crashing from the sugar buzz yet ? ''
` ` probably from a sugar buzz .
and sugar , you 're close to hysterical .
the flavor was sugar ... something . ''
` ` sugar pie , honey bun , doll face , knowing my tastes so well , which dessert would you pick for me ? ''
` ` stay with me , sugar . ''
i am sorry for takin ' advantage of your sweet nature , but damn , sugar , i wanted a taste of you .
` ` come on , sugar , '' he cajoled with a smile .
because sugar , i feel it too .
` ` like i said , sugar .
` ` ever been nekkid with a man , sugar ? ''
` ` not what i was gon na suggest , but sugar , i 'll take more of them sweet and hot kisses anytime you wan na give them to me . ''
` ` sugar , do n't leave me .
` ` you 'll wear out them pretty shoes if you keep doin ' that , sugar . ''
` ` sugar , you are pretty as a picture in your sunday mornin ' finery . ''
not with the way you look , although , sugar , you are the prettiest woman i ' ve ever seen , but because you inherited all these responsibilities and you just accept them without question and you 're not bitter about it . ''
` ` yes or no , sugar .
` ` what , sugar ? ''
` ` where do you want to touch me , sugar ? ''
` ` no , sugar , it 's much better . ''
` ` i missed you , sugar . ''
` ` sugar .
` ` sugar , you 're just that innocent .
` ` sugar , you still with me ? ''
` ` sugar , you oughta come in .

` ` you got more than a little sass in ya , doncha , sugar ? ''
` ` sugar , what 's the rush ? ''

` ` i ' m sure , but sugar , it looks like you need it . ''
` ` such a sweet , sweet pu**y , sugar , '' he murmured beneath her jaw .
` ` sugar . ''
` ` sugar , is this really how you 're spendin ' all your days ? ''
` ` sugar , are we really alone ? ''
` ` trust me , sugar , you want this . ''
` ` that seems to be the norm with you sugar , and i like it .
` ` words lie , but sugar , your body do n't . ''
this is me makin ' love to you , sugar . ''
` ` sugar , i ' m not like- '' your family , ` ` -i do n't expect you to cook for me if you do n't want to . ''
` ` sugar , are you sure ? ''
` ` not a line , sugar .
` ` i ' m done hidin ' , sugar .
` ` sugar , you did n't tell me you were datin ' someone else before you met me . ''
she brought out the food - roast pork , mashed potatoes , gravy , wheat rolls and a medley of cooked carrots , onions and sugar snap peas .
we thank you for the wheat farmers who toil over their grain harvest every fall , for the mills that grind that grain into flour , and the skill of the baker who can mix water , salt , yeast , sugar and flour into the warm , crunchy , melt in your mouth buttery rolls before us .
` ` just kiddin ' , sugar . ''
` ` come on , sugar , we got places to be . ''
` ` interestin ' look on your face , sugar .

` ` sugar , put your britches back on or i ' m afraid we wo n't leave this bed the rest of the night . ''

` ` sugar ?
` ` no , sugar , it sounds perfect . ''
later , sugar . ''
` ` hiya , sugar .
` ` lose the slip , sugar . ''
you looked that young , but sugar , you never acted that young .
` ` how much have you had to drink tonight , sugar ? ''
` ` i love you too , sugar . ''
` ` you want it , sugar , take it . ''
` ` i ' m sorry , sugar , i did n't quite hear that . ''
` ` sugar , '' she lied .
` ` you 're a good dancer , sugar . ''
` ` sugar , you shoulda told me you were married .
i ' m tellin ' it like i saw it , sugar .
` ` carson , please- '' ` ` sugar , i need you to look at me when you come . ''
` ` one more , sugar .

drop your drawers , sugar , i ai n't gon na ask again , '' she mimicked in his cowboy drawl .
` ` this mean and nasty streak from that sugar sweet mouth of yours is givin ' me wood , '' he said as he unbuckled his belt and tugged his clothing down to the tops of his boots .
and do n't take this the wrong way , sugar , but i suspect you and kimi share everything and there 's some stuff between a husband and a wife that should n't be shared .
` ` sugar , do n't cry . ''
` ` sugar , you okay ? ''
` ` lots of practice on you , sugar . ''
` ` so get movin ' and ride me hard , sugar ; time 's a'wastin ' . ''
cocoa , sugar , flour , chocolate chips , a bag of wrapped caramels , and the dark pan she swore was the reason her brownies were always so good .
` ` okay , sugar , that was a total lie .
` ` that was a happy sigh , sugar . ''
` ` then sugar , i ' m gon na tie you up a bit . ''
` ` always know what , sugar ? ''
` ` same goes , sugar .
you ' ve been nesting the past two weeks and , sugar , give it a rest . ''
an hour later ... ` ` come on , sugar , you 're almost there . ''
` ` everyone is gon na flip , sugar .
the sugar buzz wore off and he started to crash .
` ` sorry about your aunt hulda , sugar . ''
your ma is gon na take care of me , right , sugar ? ''
` ` sugar , they 're teenage boys .
` ` sugar , i love that dirty mouth of yours .
` ` hey sugar .
` ` what 's goin ' through that pretty head of yours , sugar ? ''
` ` never get tired of hearin ' you beg for it , sugar . ''
` ` it always feels good but i love it when you 're dripping for me , sugar . ''
it might not be as urgent as it once was , it may ' ve grown and changed and ai n't as frequent as either of us would like it to be , but sugar , it 's still there .
` ` carson- '' ` ` sugar , i ' m not bein ' flip . ''
` ` anytime , sugar . ''
` ` sugar , come on and see the inside .
` ` yeah , but sugar , we do n't have any food or supplies . ''
i love you , sugar .
` ` sugar , that ai n't even close to the truth . ''
but i ' ve been worried and you wo n't tell me what 's going on- '' ` ` sugar , i was talkin ' to my horse . ''
` ` sugar , if these ladies are bathing you , i 'll step out for bit . ''
` ` sugar , i survived six pregnancies with you .
` ` sugar , you sure this is what you want ? ''
` ` sugar , just breathe , okay ? ''
` ` liesl is not lookin ' for the truth , sugar .
` ` hey , sugar , what can i do for you tonight ? ''
` ` sugar , that 's expensive .
` ` you got it , sugar , '' she says , turning away with an extra sway in her hips to get the bottle .
` ` here ya go , sugar . ''

she joined me and started dumping sugar and milk into her drink .
not wanting to waste time when there 's powdered sugar involved , i thank caroline for warning me and return to packing my bag as i hear her skip down the stairs .
or at least i try to part ways ; while calvin and regina argue in the opposite direction , violet glues herself to my side , chattering on about an article on getting over a bad breakup that she read ( ` ` supremely helpful , even if i could n't partake of the sugar - free ice cream . '' )

and sugar .
i watch as she assembles flour , sugar , and eggs on the countertop .
she glares at me , ripping open a package of butter and dumping it in a bowl with a scoop of sugar .
i edge toward the window , staring like he 's some kind of hallucination brought on by too much sugar and wishful thinking .
all this talk about my imminent departure is making me restless , and in need of a sugar fix .
i do n't know yet about the internship i 'll get here next summer , working with the tourism board to promote eco - friendly travel in british columbia ; i have n't seen the small , cute apartment mom and me will move to , or dad 's place in sweden , where i 'll spend christmas , stringing sugar cookies to the tree and eating local smorgasbord .
` ` as long as it includes sugar and caffeine , '' i reply lightly , as if i have n't just been meditating on his delicious abs .
i pour half the canister of sugar into my coffee , the only way i can stand it so black and strong .

` ` that 's from the butter and sugar , '' josh explains .
` ` i could get tickets , if you want ... ... '' ` ` sure , sounds fun , '' i reply , scrubbing my hands clean in the sink ( since i ' m guessing that licking the sugar off would n't be the classiest move ) .
a customer arrives out in the cafe , so i do n't have time to dwell on josh 's weird mood swing , but it must be the day for it , because everyone who walks through that door all morning seems to have a dour scowl on their face , even with the sweet , sweet scents of cinnamon and sugar wafting through the air .

he seemed quite happy to take gulps of his , and no sugar had been added , so i took a few sips .
nothing i did - stroking , sugar cubes , muttering in sagean - worked .
` ` not again , sugar , m'tired , '' ty muttered as he flopped onto his side and jostled them both in the cramped seats .
` ` looking for a date , sugar ? ''
` ` if it 'll make you feel better , '' he said as he mixed sugar into his coffee .
figured some sugar might do you good . ''
the plate was filled with rolled strips of leftover pie crust , baked and covered with cinnamon and sugar .
` ` morning , sir , '' he answered , reaching for one of the coffee mugs and the sugar bowl after sopping up the juice on his plate with his napkin .

if there was powdered sugar on it , it 's long since blown way .
` ` nonfat , no sugar .
instead , i sink into my seat and gaze out the window at the evergreens and the kaleidoscope of sugar maples that speed by in a dizzying blur .

` ` i think high on sugar emily is going to be much more entertaining than drunken emily .
she asked , before aggressively opening a sugar sachet and pouring it into her coffee mug .

the kind with chocolate and sugar , all in a really , really tall cup .

he shrugs as the waitress sets three baskets of square , fried dough with powdered sugar liberally dumped on the top on the table , along with our chickaree coffee .
i smirk again and pick up a warm , fragrant beignet , shake a bit of the excess sugar off , and take a bite .
i grin slowly and brush my foot up and down his calf as i take another bite , making sure i lick the excess sugar off my lips .
i shake it over her shoulder , dropping powdered sugar on her skin and lean down and lick it off .
i grin and pull the sheet down to her waist , exposing her perfect little body , and shake more sugar over her breasts .
i chuckle as i feed her the remaining portion of the fried dough , then dive in the bag for another and continue to shake the sugar on her delectable body , then eat the beignet , sharing pieces with her .
i shake some sugar over her pussy and watch it fall like snow on her pink flesh .
so i lean forward and lick her , from her soft folds to that warm metal , and all around , licking up every last bit of sugar , then take a bite of donut .

who knew sugar could be so fucking sexy ?
he watches me closely for a moment and then shrugs , tosses a sugar and cinnamon doughnut into his mouth and leads me farther into the market .
` ` well , before you all get high on sugar , let 's have dinner . ''
` ` it 's a lot of sugar , '' i reply .
` ` like i said , too much sugar , '' i reply and take another bite of the turkey sandwich dominic delivered .
when both containers are empty , we lie in sugar comas and watch the movie , cuddled up on the couch .

` ` sugar , who gives a fuck where it starts ?
` ` god , i love the way he says sugar . ''
` ` boys do n't have orgasms , sugar . ''
` ` how are you holding up , sugar ? ''
i do locate some sugar and salt , and miraculously , a set of measuring cups , but that wo n't get me very far .
i do n't drink it , because no matter how much sugar i put into it , it is still tastes like ass - water to me .
maybe it 's just because my taste buds are so desensitized to sweet that anything not comprised of at least ninety percent sugar tastes wrong .
` ` do you ever eat anything other than sugar ? ''
* * * we 're both on a sugar high after all the ice cream and we end up back in the garage because i have a list of projects to finish .
she brought those peanut butter cookies over last week covered in sugar with a criss - cross pattern across the top .
i like the stuff that 's full of sugar better anyway . ''
` ` because giving up your sugar is like giving up your life 's blood .
it must be a nightmare to keep them clean in a place full of melting sugar .
i ' m wondering if i can sneak into the kitchen unnoticed and hide half of the cupcakes now , because i ' m going to need the sugar to get through the rest of this night .
` ` no wonder you always smell like brown sugar and , '' he stops , picking up a bottle off of the counter and reading the label , ` ` pure vanilla extract . ''
she does smell like brown sugar and vanilla , but i thought i was the only one who noticed .
` ` you know , '' i say , pushing a bag of brown sugar and another measuring cup at him since he wants to pack things so badly , ` ` one day i may not be here , and then you 'll be cookieless and sad . ''
there is n't any point in arguing with that , so i step over to show him how hard to pack down the brown sugar , but i still feel shitty .
i take the bag of brown sugar he 's still holding and put it back so i can have an excuse to turn away , because i ' m not in the mood for serious , and for some reason , this conversation keeps veering back toward places i do n't want to go .
she removes the foil and puts the plate of sugar cookies on the table and tells me to sit .
i finally told her that until she made me something with chocolate in it , i would not be tasting another sugar cookie .
this was finished off with a cafetiere of coffee , a mug , a small jug filled with milk , a sugar bowl and a tiny salt and pepper shaker .
i measured three , gargantuan , heaping teaspoons of sugar into lucien 's coffee , splashed mine with milk , asked edwina her preference and then passed them around .
but leah has a heavy hand with the sugar . ''
then he gave up , walked us into the nearest coffee house ( there were a billion ) , got me a latte , him a double espresso with enough sugar to down an elephant and we were away home .
` ` milk , one sugar , '' she said , grabbing the pill bottle on the counter and making to move out .
and he 'd also eat them warm , the second i finished rolling them in powdered sugar and putting them in the tin .
he opened the tin and the sweet , nutty smell of doughy goodness wafted out as he saw a massive mound of frankie 's chocolate - filled , powdered - sugar - rolled christmas cookies sitting in it .
when we got to the kitchen and i shared them ( steaks , sauteed mushrooms , loaded baked potatoes , steamed asparagus , pillsbury crescent rolls , and store - bought - but - still - awesome sugar cream pie for dessert ) , ben liked my plans for dinner .
he asked as she plucked a powdered sugar , chocolate - cream - filled donut out of the box and turned to him .
and you have our dog to walk and powdered sugar , chocolate - cream - filled donuts , three of them at least , to go out and buy for me .
* * * * * i had three donuts in my belly , only two that were powdered sugar , chocolate - cream - filled .
you ca n't take care of his weak wife and his two boys to crawl up his ass and try to convince him you 're sugar and spice . ''
blondie , layne knew even though he could n't see her , was lying at the foot of tripp 's stool licking up powdered sugar residue that fell from tripp 's donut onto the floor .
layne poured a cup of coffee , spooned in two sugars and was stirring it when he turned and saw devin sauntering back to the island in wife beater and slacks .
quietly and politely , kate told him , ` ` cream and sugar are over there . ''
she decided to bring donuts to the station and , while spreading her sugar cheer , share all that shit with the guys , mike bein ' one of them . ''
` ` sugar cream , '' keira placed her own vote .
i slid a piece of toast on a plate and started slathering it with cream cheese i 'd beat up with powdered sugar , vanilla , slivered almonds and the zest of an orange .
` ` thought fellini was dead , '' jake noted bizarrely , pouring a long stream of sugar from a silver - topped glass container into his coffee .
he kept pouring for a bit then put the sugar down and turned to me .
` ` you use too much sugar in your coffee , '' i blurted .
i took the coffees , left mine black , poured a frightening amount of sugar and two powdered cream packets into jake 's and called another farewell to tom as i started to move to my cayenne .
there was sugar .
` ` porridge oats , bread , butter , sugar and salt beef , '' he went on .
this table was laid with ornate silver , china , a crystal vase holding a single , perfect peach rose and it also held my breakfast which appeared to be french toast dusted with powdered sugar and covered in sliced strawberries , something rich , creamy and yummy - looking oozing out of the middle , coffee , orange juice and a jug of water with actual ice .
this would be good since i wo n't be going to any games , i ' m making it clear he 's out of the picture and he 'll have to find another sugar mama who can count cards . ''
` ` sugar cookies next time . ''
she cried even though i knew she had no clue what sugar cookies were just as her brother tugged her nearer the house , murmuring , ` ` come on , elan . ''
` ` sugar ! ''
` ` and we rolled them in pretty colored sugar crystals so they 're all blue and pink and green ! ''
mrs . truman waved him on his way at the same time she spooned three sugars ( a fact abby found unbelievable , there was nothing sweet about mrs . truman ) into her tea .
` ` spit it out , abigail , we do n't have all day , '' mrs . truman asked then bit into a sugar - coated jam donut , consuming at least a quarter in one bite .
instead he poured coffee in delicate china cups , adding milk to abby 's , taking his black with a sugar .
or , she wanted to say something about wanting a pot of jam or a sugar bowl on the table , because at the very least she took sugar in her coffee , not to mention her oatmeal .
or , she wanted to say something about wanting a pot of jam or a sugar bowl on the table , because at the very least she took sugar in her coffee , not to mention her oatmeal .
she had n't wasted any time ; there was a sugar bowl , a butter dish and three pots of jam on the table .
` ` i ' m not referring to the sugar bowl , julia , '' he explained .
her words were uttered in a sugar sweet tone that he knew from years of experience she did n't mean .
all sign of sugar bowl , butter and jam was away the next morning at the breakfast table .
` ` i was reading about the master and mistress last night , '' julia told her as she got up to grab mugs , sugar bowl , teaspoons and the jug of milk out of the fridge .
he nodded and she poured , adding no milk or sugar and walked to him to hand him a cup .
he continued to regard her , wondering at her mood , as she made her own , one sugar and a splash of milk .
colin liked his coffee strong ; a splash of milk , no sugar , the potion would n't change the taste one bit ( she hoped ) .
course after course followed , a nice goat 's cheese wrapped in puff pastry with red onion marmalade and then a huge , succulent portobello mushroom cap topped with puy lentils and minced garlic drenched in olive oil with a side of sugar snap peas .
` ` it 's fruit and sugar and fruit is sugar so there 's no way for it not to be sweet , '' mikey hilariously explained .
` ` it 's fruit and sugar and fruit is sugar so there 's no way for it not to be sweet , '' mikey hilariously explained .
it was supposed to be a crumble but she 'd been distracted by her boxes arriving and she was unpacking at the same time she was getting the christmas decorations out therefore she accidentally doubled the brown sugar and the butter so it ended up a gooey , caramelized mess which the children had adored .
right now she was wearing a denim mini - skirt with a ragged , cut - off hem , a bright yellow tank top with ` ` sugar '' written across the chest in glitter and flip flops .
kitty sue breathed a sigh of relief , sent us a dazzling smile and put sugar in her coffee .
i held my breath as i spooned sugar in eddie 's coffee .
eddie did n't take his eyes off me , even as he reached for the sugar ( eddie took lots of sugar in his coffee , i 'd memorized this fact right away , as i memorized practical y everything about eddie ) .
eddie did n't take his eyes off me , even as he reached for the sugar ( eddie took lots of sugar in his coffee , i 'd memorized this fact right away , as i memorized practical y everything about eddie ) .

daisy turned cornflower - blue eyes to me , ` ` al right , sugar , tel auntie daisy al about it . ''
she leaned into me , ` ` you and me , sugar , we 're steel magnolias . ''
` ` maybe i should try to do this myself , you and indy ... '' daisy shook her head and with what i was noticing was her customary brutal honesty , she said , ` ` i ca n't have babies , sugar , marcus and me been tryin ' for two years .
i introduced daisy , she put her hand in his and said , straight out , ` ` sugar bunch , you are fine . ''
` ` magic , sugar , '' she answered .

` ` shit , sugar , did vince blow some bossy into you , or what ? ''

` ` sugar bunch , you can say that again , '' daisy cal ed .
` ` hey sugar bunch , what 're you wearin ' for your date ? ''
` ` powdered sugar , cream cheese ? ''
it sounds like a hoot and you could use a few giggles , am i right , sugar ? ''
` ` you can ride with me , sugar .
` ` sugar , you look scared as a jackrabbit , '' daisy said .
` ` trust me sugar , i - '' then she stopped talking , her eyes got big and she looked beyond me , out the side window .
someone who had powdered sugar in the cupboard and cream cheese in the fridge so she could make him better french toast than i 'd made ; the special kind with the sweetened cream cheese spread in the middle .
` ` yo , sugar , '' daisy replied .
` ` you got ta stay until thursday , sugar , come to my do .
` ` sugar !
` ` jet , sugar bunch , i do n't think roxie 's gray , '' daisy put in gently .
` ` are you crying , sugar bunch ? ''
` ` oh sugar , are n't you sweet ? ''
i pul ed the wrap off and daisy squealed , ` ` sugar , you sure can put the sparkle on . ''
` ` sugar , i ' m talking to marcus to - night , '' daisy broke in .
he 'd finished his donut and was wiping powdered sugar from his lips with his napkin .
` ` oh , sugar , chil .
` ` so , what your sayin ' , sugar bunch , is that you are now official y moved in with eddie , '' daisy said .
i saw a new canister set for flour , sugar and coffee ( i had no doubt al of them fil ed ) against the back kitchen counter .
` ` no , marcus built it for me , sugar .
` ` wel , sugar , you made certain sure i ' m gon na get a doozy of a write - up in the society pages , '' daisy told me on a tinkling laugh , trying to lighten the mood .
` ` marcus , sugar bunches of love , bring us some champagne , '' daisy cal ed to marcus but his head was already in their big , industrial - sized , stainless steel refrigerator .
` ` sugar , i ' m guessin ' your man did n't tel you but some minds have changed while you ' ve been gone . ''
` ` that ai n't a bad thing , sugar , '' daisy put in .
` ` you ai n't wrong about that , sugar , '' this was obviously daisy .
` ` sugar , i just love that sweater !
you drink coffee , sugar ? ''
` ` all right , sugar , i believe you , '' she said then giggled and it sounded like tinkly bells .
then i had this situation where a loan shark was after my dad but came after me , then some other guy tried to rape me and then - '' ` ` i ' m still sorry about that , sugar , '' daisy cut in .
spill , sugar .
you go horseback ridin ' , sugar ? ''
` ` sugar , you got that right , '' daisy replied .
` ` oh sugar , what happened ? ''
` ` sugar , talk to us , '' daisy grabbed my hand .
` ` sugar , how ... exactly ... is vance acting like someone you 'd wan na break up with ? ''
` ` too late , sugar .
` ` what 's that , sugar ? ''
` ` oh sugar , it ai n't that bad , '' daisy threw in .
` ` get that , will you , sugar ?
lay down , sugar .
` ` hey sugar ! ''
` ` you betcha , sugar , '' daisy said and pulled out her cell phone and started stabbing at the buttons with her long , lethally - pointed fingernail .
` ` sure thing , sugar , '' daisy had arrived .
` ` hey sugar , what 's up ? ''
` ` all right , sugar , '' daisy replied , now her tone was quiet , not a whisper but barely there .
` ` smithie , sugar , law 's given up the street , '' daisy cut in .
` ` what ' cha gon na do now , sugar ? ''
` ` you called it , sugar , '' daisy giggled and it sounded like tinkling bells .
` ` do you take sugar or milk ? ''
* * * * * ` ` how 's it goin ' , sugar ? ''
` ` sugar , you can say that again , '' daisy answered .
daisy ( over the phone while sissy was dropping me back at luke 's ) : ` ` sugar , take it one minute at a time .
` ` what on earth happened , sugar ? ''
` ` i ' m thinkin ' we 're not in the straightaway here , am i wrong sugar ? ''
` ` sugar , everyone is lookin ' for you .
` ` sugar , i know you 're lookin ' for a way to protect your heart .
` ` sugar , '' daisy said softly and she sounded disappointed .
` ` that 's because you 're a steel magnolia , sugar , '' daisy chimed in .
` ` sugar , i said it , '' daisy replied .
i called , sounding sweet as sugar .
` ` sugar , do n't you think you need to eat somethin ' , considerin ' you 're drinkin ' enough for all of us ? ''
` ` we'l get you taken care of , sugar bunch , not to worry . ''
` ` oh sugar , '' daisy whispered and i saw her eyes had tears in them .
` ` sugar , that ai n't the half of it , '' daisy added and she sounded excited .
` ` she made coffee , put out the cups , cream and sugar and stomped off . ''
` ` if it 's any comfort , sugar , they got a great picture of mace carrying you out of the club last night .
` ` sugar , why 'd you do a fool thing like that ? ''
` ` this page is done , sugar , you got to turn the page , '' daisy got close .
` ` and we would n't miss your opening for the world , sugar . ''
` ` sugar , how you doin ' ? ''
` ` life goes on , sugar , '' daisy returned on a shrug .
` ` ava , sugar , go get stel a a cup of coffee , '' daisy said softly and a chil ran up my spine as ava nodded and took off on her errand .
` ` so why 're you and mace estranged , sugar ?
i could make mace breakfasts of eggs benedict and belgian waffles topped with strawberries and whipped cream and homemade blueberry pancakes smothered in warm maple syrup and apple coffeecake with a thick crust of brown sugar crumble ( or whatever ) every morning for the rest of his effing life and it would never make him happy enough to let this shit go .
` ` shoulda done that a long time ago , sugar , '' daisy said then she gave me a wink .
reporting in ( regularly , as in , every half an hour ) , daisy told me she 'd got them settled in rooms fil ed with flowers and ` ` big old '' boxes of godiva chocolates ( ` ` sugar , i said those were from you , hope you do n't mind , '' daisy told me , and i did n't , how could i ? ) .
` ` sure thing , sugar , '' daisy scooted around toward stevie .
` ` sadie , sugar , you asleep ? ''
` ` sadie , sugar - '' she started but before she could say more the door opened and hector walked in .
` ` oh sugar , '' i heard daisy say , her voice trembling but hector was coming at me and i kept my eyes on him .
sometimes ralphie would even make a pot of coffee and walk out to hector 's bronco to give him a warm up , carrying milk and sugar .
ralphie informed me hector took a splash of milk and one sugar like this was information which i could impart on saint peter and he would lead me straight through the pearly gates to the right hand of god .
` ` well , sugar , i got ta admit , you 're right .
` ` sugar , that ai n't the half of it . ''
i made my coffee ( dash of milk , one sugar , just like hector ) .
` ` sadie , sugar - '' daisy whispered gently and at her words the rock chicks and ralphie pulled in ever closer .
` ` how 's it hangin ' , sugar ? ''
` ` you know , sugar , i been through what you been through , '' daisy told me .
` ` mornin ' sugar , i brought hangover donuts , '' daisy called , waving a glazed in my direction .
then she scrunched her nose , took a bite of a powdered sugar , chocolate icing filled donut and grinned .
then daisy said , ` ` sugar , count your lucky stars he gave you a week of f**kin ' around .
monty made coffee and shirleen , who did n't file but apparently did serve coffee or at least she did to recently returned kidnap victims , brought it in with milk , sugar and mugs .
` ` who you think taught her to dance , sugar ? ''
well , sugar , '' she leaned in and her eyes narrowed , ` ` the time has come for you to spill .
and sugar , you know we will . ''
` ` and sugar , i need to find a way to spend my days , '' she kept going .
` ` oh my god , sugar , that is such a good idea ! ''
` ` oo , sugar , that one 's way good , '' daisy again agreed .
` ` ohmigod , '' the woman breathed to the one at her side , ` ` daisy called me ' sugar ' . ''
` ` sure i called you sugar , sugar , '' daisy said on a huge bright smile .
` ` sure i called you sugar , sugar , '' daisy said on a huge bright smile .
the woman lifted her shoulders up to her ears and her eyes went dreamy , not like daisy was calling her sugar , but like channing tatum had just kissed her cheek .
on ring three , daisy answered , ` ` everything good , sugar ? ''
` ` see you soon , sugar . ''
then she touched my cheek and whispered , ` ` we 'll talk in the mornin ' , sugar . ''
` ` you want pancakes , sugar ? ''
` ` oh , sugar , '' daisy waved a hand with silver polish on her long nails tipped with aquamarine rhinestones in the shapes of hearts , ` ` me and marcus got a room .
that was to say , with powdered sugar sweetened cream cheese sandwiched in the middle ( we could just say it was good ren cooked - he had everything in his kitchen ) .
` ` of course , ren , '' she said , sweet as sugar on an eyes - hooded smile that said - right in front of me - she 'd hold anything he asked .
` ` good you 're here , sugar .

` ` all in a day 's work , sugar . ''
` ` no offense , sugar , but you 're not my type . ''
` ` bye , sugar , '' jamie said , and kissed me on the cheek .
i emptied my pockets to find some change , a packet of sugar , a receipt , and of course , my ipod .
mara kisses me and it is sugar on my tongue and champagne in my blood ; i want to drown in her taste and scent and sound .
murderous bitches , women who liked to dip their tongues in too much green sugar , who did what they had to do to get their husbands inheritances .
` ` none of that matters right now , victor '' -i drop two teaspoons of sugar into my cup and begin to stir it with a plastic spoon- '' dina is all that matters to me .
or more likely , from sugar daddy .
scooting up to lean against the headboard , her eyes narrowed as she caught sight of the fluffy waffles perfectly browned and dusted with cinnamon and powdered sugar with a dollop of whip cream on top of the stack .
and a sugar mommy who was not only young , but beautiful enough to make any male hot and bothered .
the night air was edged with frost and the countryside filled with sugar maples that were in full glory , painting the dark sky in shades of gold and crimson .
maybe a sugar glaze or something , '' dad said , looking over my shoulder from where he was preparing lunch for the students .
` ` that was a big mistake , sugar , '' husky grinned .

i grit my teeth , holding back the snide remark that sits at the very tip of my tongue , and i respond instead , ` ` sure as sugar , bob .
` ` does n't work that way , sugar .
but as she licked her lips to savor every last drop ... wow , all those bubbles and sugar and caffeine tasted so good .
` ` but i ' m sure mr . vincent would love a cup of coffee , black with extra sugar , thank you . ''
especially when she was dangling over the edge of a release so sweet that she could practically taste it like sugar on her tongue .
to remember every flavor of sugar and spice on her lips as he 'd kissed her ?
she drew back just far enough to murmur , ` ` you taste so good , like lemons and sugar and you , '' and then she was kissing him again , slicking her tongue over his lower lip .
seconds later , the campfire erupted into a full - on food fight where no one was safe from flying chocolate or puffed sugar .
she was holding out something long and sticky and covered in sugar .
her stomach growled , and she knew she was going to be cranky without her daily hit of morning sugar , but losing half a day to travel meant she needed to get the ball rolling on high priority items before she dropped in to craft services to get something to eat .
her stomach growled in immediate response to the fluffy cinnamon bun that dripped with sugar on the beautiful hand - thrown , green plate .
her eyes closed as the hit of sugar , perfectly spiced with cinnamon , hit her tongue , and a low moan of pleasure escaped her lips .
sweet like spun sugar , with just the slightest kick of exotic spice .
before she could ask him why he was blindfolding her , valentina smelled sugar and chocolate .
dripping with sugar , just the way i like them . ''
nor could he stop himself from leaning over to lick off the sugar glistening at the corner of her mouth .
he took her mouth a moment later , devouring the hints of sugar and spice that remained on her already sweet lips .
a weakness only rivaled by her need for a straight shot of sugar first thing in the morning ... and her growing , borderline desperate weakness for the man beside her .
and then he was pulling her inside with at least as much excitement as the eight - year - olds who were hopped up on slushies and sugar sticks .
i want to kiss the sugar off your lips while you 're eating sweets for breakfast .
the surface of her lips tasted like red wine and sugar and all ryan wanted was to deepen the kiss and keep kissing her for hours .
fortunately , her dog did n't seem to have any of the same qualms , especially when he sniffed the glazed sugar on zach 's fingers from the donut he 'd been eating for breakfast .
she ran her finger over the rim of her drink and sucked the sugar off it , which made him ache beneath the table .
the sugar from last night 's slushie had given heather a headache , which was exacerbated by the fact that every time she closed her eyes , she saw zach and herself dressed in the period clothes from the movie acting out a scene where he pulled her into his arms and kissed her like he 'd been waiting his whole life for her love .

` ` i ' m back , '' she reassured him as she slipped him a sugar cube .
no , really , just - i probably need the sugar . ''
back out by the crime scene , she ate her sugar bomb and found the walkie - talkie was not her friend .
maybe a load of sugar and preservatives would wake her up out of this stupor .
then he did the same for himself , accepting the sugar cubes when they were offered to him and declining the scones .
and the fudge brownie had lifted her spirits a little , although that had n't lasted past the sugar buzz .
then tried to imagine himself sitting there , passing scones and the sugar bowl around with his pinkie extended and his legs crossed at the knees .
the garden tools were new , but the lay 's potato - chip stand and the three different kinds of sugar cookies in their plastic containers were exactly what had been there before .
he arranged the teapot and the caddies of sugar and cream and also the rounder that held the assortment of scones and biscuits .
in spite of the coke and its one - two punch of sugar and caffeine , he was suddenly sucked - under - the - ocean exhausted .
and that was where things were headed with him ... as her brain twisted in her skull , she took a sip of coffee , burned her lip , and in her frustration , decided there simply was n't enough sugar in with her caffeine .
reaching forward for the little sugar pot , she extended her arm from her shoulder , tilted her torso over her hips , and- her body did n't so much stiffen as freeze in that position - as if all the joints that were engaged had become solid at once .
and then she collapsed , her head slamming down onto the lip of the coffee mug , the scone bouncing off its plate , the clattering of the sugar bowl and the thunderous impact of her chest on the table like a bomb going off .
especially if there was sugar involved .

max : cupcake , i thought i was all the sugar you needed .
and because you deserve a sugar rush . ''

` ` no milk , one sugar .
` ` i 'll take a latte , one sugar and a bagel with cream cheese . ''
she handed me a white snoopy cup with lipstick on the rim and some packets of sugar .

despite her instructions , preston had brought back doughnuts and waffles , with strawberries and whipped cream , and no sugar - free syrup .
his body needed sugar to bring him out of it .
his eyelashes rested on his pale cheeks as his body tried to conserve its sugar to fuel his brain .
high blood sugar damages all the body 's major organs .
his brain requires sugar to survive .
but if max goes too low and there 's simply not enough sugar in his blood ... '' her words dwindled off , which was all the answer preston needed .

` ` maybe tonight , no sugar .
` ` sugar , '' he quipped .
` ` sleep , '' i insisted , as he gave me a look that said he was a man intent on getting some sugar .
some nights , that was my sugar .
as we walked , he pointed out the different shops : the bakery where they made the best sugar cookies , the place where he got his new shoes every year for school , and as we walked and he talked , he seemed less and less nervous .
while frank told me i 'd better watch out and i 'd better not cry , i mixed up a batch of snickerdoodles , rolled in extra cinnamon sugar .
while judy sang to me of having a merry little christmas , i doused pecan sandies in powdered sugar , gently setting them to cool on wire racks that covered the dining room table .

sophia asked , shaking a sugar packet .
we sat down across from each other at the island , and while she added sugar to her mug , i looked at her carefully .

` ` come get your sugar , '' i teased as he brought his lips to mine .
` ` mmm , more of that sugar you promised me . ''
i shuffled to the door , noticing there was sugar all over the floor , brown and white , and i was performing an accidental soft - shoe dance .
he shuffled through the sugar and paused to swipe a finger through a bowl lined with melted chocolate .
now lose the panties and gim me some sugar . ''
` ` hell yes , '' i cried , sliding against him , manipulating my body against his , honey and sugar slick and gritty between us .
now gim me some sugar . ''

making an extra strong coffee with the mandatory three spoons of sugar , i grab my phone and walk into the living room , sitting down in my window seat that i love so much .
after putting my mandatory three sugars in my coffee , i glance up at him expectantly .
a girl who has the perfect mix of sugar and spice .
i only hope that dress of hers is stuck to her like glue or else she 's going to give her sugar daddy a heart attack .
she does n't come across as the type of woman who 's looking for a sugar daddy , which makes her date even more of a crack up .
i did n't want to come across as a high class hooker looking for a new sugar daddy .
she 's an addict when it comes to the sugar water . ''

he unfolded the top , revealing two brownies topped with a dusting of powdered sugar .

others were round , like giant sugar canisters .
it was some kind of caramely goodness with whipped cream and just enough sugar .
i was a vegetarian , so i made up for the lack of meat with veggies and sugar .
the place smelled like grease , sugar , and chocolate .
tate smelled like lemon and sunshine and sugar , a weirdly ethereal combination for a city administrator , but delicious all the same .
walking into the foyer , i was immediately comforted by the sounds and smells of home - lemon furniture polish , cinnamon and sugar , the slightly musty smell of an older home , the low murmur of the television .
` ` by destroying the living room and going into sugar shock ? ''
that smell - of bright lemons and sugar - reminded me of tate .
the chocolate sponge cake was just the right balance of tangy chocolate and not - too - sweet cake , which matched up perfectly against a cream filling that reeked of sugar .
besides , we were the only beings alive who could eat processed sugar and carbs with impunity - why not go for it , right ?
ethan looked unimpressed by the sugar log i 'd placed in his hand .
there was also a faint scent of lemon and sugar in [ andt was the air , which always seemed to be the case around tate .
as i stepped onto the street , i caught scents of water and city and sulfur , but there was something else : the smel s of lemon and sugar , the same scents i 'd caught around tate .
whenever i ' m around him , i smel lemon and sugar .
i fil ed her in on my lemon and sugar theory .
i told them about the old magic claudia had mentioned and the scents of lemon and sugar that catcher had n't been convinced were meaningful .
whenever i ' m in your presence , i smel lemon and sugar - like cookies baking . ''
and why did the city smel like lemon and sugar after it rained ? ''
he also thinks tate 's bluffing , and he put some stock into your lemon and sugar theory .
as i stood there , i 'd have sworn i caught the scents of lemon and sugar in the air again .
the sudden punch of peppery magic that filed the car - and the cloying scent of sugar and lemons that accompanied it - proved this was a magical problem ... and a problem i knew al too wel .
i closed my eyes ... and smeled the faint aromas of lemon and sugar .
` ` he has a scent - lemon and sugar . ''
i felt stupid suggesting it - what supernatural creature smeled like sugar cookies ?
nothing but the lingering , cloying scent of lemon and sugar .
now that cabot was gone , sugar was back in play .
he was possibly an old creature and smeled like lemon and sugar .
the smels of lemon and sugar filed the air .
` ` sure thing , sugar lips .
` ` seth smels like lemon and sugar .
the smel of lemon and sugar filed the room - the sugar - cookie smel of a milennia - old angel in twenty - first - century chicago .

he put a hand on my shoulder , then walked past me toward the door , lemons and sugar in his wake .
they released into the night , sending that sugar cookie smel through the park .
i opened the door and was hit by the scents of sugar and yeast .
` ` anything you want , sugar , '' she said with a wink , tapping the edges of our menus on the tabletop to straighten them , then disappearing into the back .
the sugar and butter had to be creamed just so , until the mixture was light and fluffy .
the air smelled deliciously of fried food and sugar .
some enjoyed cotton candy ; others tore pieces of steaming funnel cake from paper plates , their shirts and fingers dotted with a spray of powdered sugar .
seth had left chicago , and his scent had been different - lemon and sugar , like freshly baked cookies .
still , i caught the smells of lemon and sugar .
it did n't care that i 'd had breakfast ; it recognized sugar and fat .
i needed something with sugar .
` ` got ta have my sugar . ''
that way all the others can have some sugar , too . ''
` ` you need the sugar , darlin ' .
the air was scented with the sweet smell of chocolate and sugar .
and because my anxiety and stress meter was off the charts , i ordered a large brown sugar latte .

the sugar press stood abandoned , the oxen grazing placidly in the long grass at the edge of the clearing .

the history of this family is that it has come from martinique it is said that charlotte is most eager for all the planters to join together to create a sugar refinery here , so that they may reap higher profits from their crops there is also much talk of driving our dutch ships out of the caribbean , as it seems we are still most prosperous , and the french and spanish envy us but no doubt you know more of that than i do , stefan .
it supported the catholic church in saint - domingue , and one son of pierre fontenay , charlotte 's brother - in - law , became a priest two women in the family became carmelite nuns one was executed in the french revolution , along with all the members of her community the money of the colonial family , during all these years as their coffee and sugar and tobacco poured into europe and into north america , was frequently deposited in foreign banks the degree of wealth was enormous even for the multimillionaires of hispaniola , and the family seems always to have possessed quite fantastic amounts of gold and jewels this is not at all typical of a planter family , whose fortunes are generally connected with the land and easily subject to ruin as a consequence the mayfair family survived the haitian revolution with enormous wealth , though all of its land holdings on the island were irretrievably lost it was marie claudette , who established the mayfair legacy in 1789 , right before the revolution that forced the family to leave saint - domingue her parents were by that time dead the legacy was later enhanced and refined by mane claudette after she was settled in louisiana , at which time she shifted a great portion of her money from banks in holland and rome to banks in london and in new york the legacy the legacy is an immensely complicated and quasi - legal series of arrangements , made largely through the banks holding the money , which establishes a fortune that can not be manipulated by any one country 's inheritance laws essentially it conserves the bulk of the mayfair money and property in the hands of one person in each generation , this heir to the fortune being designated by the living beneficiary , except that should the beneficiary die without making the designation , the money goes to her eldest daughter only if there is no living female descendant will the legacy go to a man however , the beneficiary may designate a male , if she chooses to the knowledge of the talamasca , the beneficiary of the legacy has never died without designating an heir , and the legacy has never passed to a male child rowan mayfair , the youngest living mayfair witch , was designated at birth by her mother deirdre , who was designated at birth by antha , who was designated by stella , and so forth and so on however , there have been times in the history of the family when the designee has been changed for example , marie claudette designated her first daughter , claire marie , and then later changed this designation to marguerite , her third child , and there is no evidence that claire marie ever knew that she was designated , though marguerite knew she was the heiress long before marie claudette 's death the legacy also provides enormous benefits for the beneficiary 's other children ( the siblings of the heir ) in each generation , the amount for women usually being twice that given to the men however , no member of the family could inherit from the legacy unless he or she used the name mayfair publicly and privately where laws prohibited the heir from using the name legally , it was nevertheless used customarily , and never legally challenged this served to keep alive the name of mayfair well into the present century and in numerous instances , members of the family passed the rule on to their descendants along with their fortunes , though nothing legally required them to do so , once they were one step removed from the original legacy the original legacy also contains complex provisions for destitute mayfairs claiming assistance , as long as they have always used the name mayfair and are descended from those who used it the beneficiary may also leave up to ten percent of the legacy to other ' mayfairs ' who are not her children , but once more , the name mayfair must be in active use by such a person or the provisions of the will are null and void in the twentieth century , numerous ' cousins ' have received money from the legacy , primarily through mary beth mayfair , and her daughter stella , but some also through deirdre , the money being administered for her by cortland mayfair many of these people are now ' rich , ' as the bequest was frequently made in connection with investments or business ventures of which the beneficiary or her administrator approved the talamasca knows today of some five hundred and fifty descendants all using the name mayfair , easily one half of these people know the core family in new orleans , and know something about the legacy , though they are many generations removed from their original inheritance stella gathered together some four hundred mayfairs and related families in 1927 at the house on first street , and there is considerable evidence that she was interested in the other psychic members of the family , but the story of stella will be related further on .
they made up the ever increasing number of ' cousins ' who were a constant factor in mayfair life for the next one hundred years there are numerous published drawings of mane claudette 's plantation house and even several photographs in old books , now out of print it was large even for the period and , predating the ostentatious greek revival style , it was a simple colonial structure with plain rounded columns , a pitched roof , and galleries , much like the house in saint - domingue it was two rooms thick , with hallways bisecting it from north to south and east to west , and had a full lower floor , as well as a very high and spacious attic floor the plantation included two enormous gargonmeres where the male members of the family lived , including lestan in his later widowhood , and his four sons , all of whom went by the name of mayfair ( maurice always lived in the main house ) marie claudette was every bit as successful in louisiana as she and her ancestors had been in saint - dommgue once again , she cultivated sugar , but gave up the cultivation of coffee and tobacco she bought smaller plantations for each of lestan 's sons , and gave lavish gifts to their children and their children 's children from the first weeks of their arrival , the family was regarded with awe and suspicion mane claudette frightened people , and entered into a number of disputes in setting up business in louisiana , and was not above threatening anyone who stood in her path she bought up enormous numbers of slaves for her fields , and in the tradition of her ancestors , treated these slaves very well but she did not treat merchants very well , and drove more than one merchant off her property with a whip , insisting that he had tried to cheat her she was described by the local witnesses as ' formidable ' and ' unpleasant , ' though still a handsome woman and her personal slaves and free mixed - blood servants were greatly feared by the slaves she purchased in louisiana within a short time , she was heralded as a sorceress by the slaves on her land , it was said that she could not be deceived , and that she could give ' the evil eye , and that she had a demon whom she could send after anyone who crossed her brother lestan was more generally liked , and apparently fell in at once with the drinking and gambling planter class of the area henri mane landry , her husband , seems to have been a likable but passive individual who left absolutely everything to his wife he read botanical journals from europe and collected rare flowers from all over the south and designed and cultivated an enormous garden at riverbend he died in bed , in 1824 , after receiving the sacraments in 1799 marie claudette gave birth to the last of her children , marguerite , who later became the designee of the legacy , and who lived in marie claudette 's shadow until marie claudette 's death in .

timing my motions with the music , i got out the eggs , sugar , vanilla , and dumped them on the center island counter .
i exhaled noisily , dumping the measured sugar into the chocolate .

i sent my eyebrows up - wishing yet again that i could do the one eyebrow thing - casually tearing three packets of sugar open at once and dumping them in not because i liked it but because the coffee smelled that old .

i 'd helped fletcher make some sugar cookies earlier .

` ` now , sugar , i 'll show you exactly what i intend to do with my knives - unless you start talking . ''
` ` your mistake , sugar . ''
` ` oh , sugar , '' i drawled .
` ` oh , there 's no need to fret , now , sugar .
` ` do n't worry , now , sugar , '' she drawled , using the same mocking tone that i had used earlier .
i raided cooper 's fridge and cabinets , pulling out flour , sugar , salt , pepper , and all of the other staples that i would need .
the smells of melted butter , sugar , cheese , and more blasted out of the oven and drifted up from the pots and pans bubbling on the stovetop , and everything else faded away , except for the steady tick - tick- tick of the egg timer on the counter , counting down the seconds until my various dishes were ready to come out of the oven .
` ` why , sugar , '' i drawled , ` ` who ever said that i was by myself ? ''
` ` oh , sugar , '' he murmured .
` ` do n't you worry , sugar , '' sebastian said , shrugging back into his tuxedo jacket .
` ` that 's right , sugar , '' sebastian murmured , his voice sounding strangely smug to my ears .
` ` keep telling yourself that , sugar . ''
i whipped flour , sugar , salt , eggs , and milk into a frothy pancake batter , then added some fresh summer blackberries , raspberries , and strawberries that jo - jo had left sitting out on the counter .
` ` tell me , sugar , '' sebastian purred , focusing his gaze on me again .
` ` why , all you had to do was ask , sugar . ''
finn eyed the almond - flavored sugar cookies in the cake stand on the counter with hungry interest .

it had so much sugar , if you put a spoon into it , it would stand up all by itself .
the jar labeled sugar had flour in it .
hell , they probably wandered over to borrow a cup of sugar from each other .
a large jar of sugar cubes stood next to the cups and next to the jar sat two boxes from duncan 's doughnuts .
a bag of dried apricots joined the cans , together with a bag of sugar , a block of chocolate , and an oversized blender .
two handfuls of apricots followed , with several cups of sugar , the chocolate , and the contents of at least six cans .
i wondered what they 'd do if i asked to borrow a cup of sugar .
pots and pans filled the front shelves , and past them flour , sugar , and other dry goods waited in large plastic containers , each with a small label .
i took the cup , added a teaspoon of sugar , crouched by arland , and lifted the corner of the towel .
rows and rows of wooden shelves , filled with cans and jars , a huge spice rack , fifty - pound bags of sugar , flour , rice ... three large freezers filled with meat .
she fished a medium - sized knife from the drawer , peeled the apples , cored and chopped them , and set them to fry slowly , sprinkling them with brown sugar .
` ` come give me some sugar ! ''
` ` what 's wrong , sugar buns ? ''
he blinked the sugar from his eyes and looked from adam to me .
over a mouthful of fried dough and powdered sugar he said , ` ` brooks brought us beignets ! ''
i ' m not sure if it was his mage genes- or just something about adam in particular- but his blood tasted both sweet and spicy , like cinnamon and sugar and cardamom and every good thing ever .

` ` that 's a lot of sugar .
it 's all rainbows , and sugar hearts , and chocolate kisses ? ''
if i had been shot and the pack found out that the beast lord 's mate and sugar woogums had been injured as a result of the people 's fuckup , they would have collective apoplexy and storm the casino . ''
apparently my sugar woogums decided it was time to make him uncomfortable .
you had sugar cookies and tea and you told me all about how your daddy killed your mom , and how you had to get strong and murder him one day .
i 'd watched them being put into a blender one by one : bananas , sugar , protein shake , chocolate , milk .
` ` good hunting , sugar woogums . ''
chocolate , sugar , almonds ... curran might like those .
` ` now come on , sugar , you know i do n't swing that way . ''

` ` i thought bones looked like a little slice of heaven , but you 're the whole cake , are n't you , sugar ? ''
his scent deepened , that blend of burnt sugar and musk tantalizing me with the evidence that he felt the same way i did .

dobson snorted in disgust and let the second freezer lid fall and whomp back into place , since it was full of innocent things like frozen packets of corn , bags of cranberries , and tubs of summer strawberries that jo - jo had added sugar to and frozen to eat during the winter months .
you 're just a pale , weak imitation of her , sugar . ''
so i tipped over a heavy metal rack lined with containers full of sugar , flour , and cornmeal in front of the double doors to keep anyone from coming at me that way .

i made a face and reached for the cream and sugar , the coffee black in my cup .
i stirred the sugar and cream in my cup .

one black , the other with plenty of cream and sugar . ''

returning to the kitchen , vicki poured herself a cup of coffee , added a splash of milk and a spoonful of sugar , then sat down to read the paper .
vicki used the lull to refill the salt and pepper shakers and the sugar bowls , then she went into the kitchen for a cup of coffee .
` ` catch ya later , sugar . ''
he had met someone else ... she cleared the last table , helped bobbie sue refill the salt and pepper shakers and replace the packets of cream and sugar substitutes , still hoping that antonio would appear , until gus came out of the kitchen to lock the front door .
peeking inside the boxes , she found everything she could possibly want , from the basics , like sugar and salt and pepper , to several kinds of bread and a variety of canned fruits and vegetables .
she poured herself a cup of coffee , added cream and sugar , and carried it into the living room .
she took a deep breath , smiling as her nostrils filled with the scent of freshly baked sugar cookies .
it held a jar of instant coffee , a half - gallon of milk , a box of assorted individual servings of cereal , a small box of sugar , a loaf of bread , lunch meat and cheese , eggs , bacon , a box of pancake mix , syrup , a jar of peanut butter , another of jelly , a six - pack of soda , butter , salt and pepper , a small jar of mayonnaise , mustard , and ketchup , as well as paper plates and a package of plastic knives , forks , and spoons , some plastic cups , and a toothbrush and toothpaste .
he shook his head , his nostrils filling with the scent of apples and cinnamon , sugar and flour .

after fixing a tall glass of iced tea laced with lemon and sugar , daisy sat at the kitchen table to eat lunch and contemplate her future .
` ` i brought sugar , milk , and honey , since i do n't know how you like your tea . ''
hurrying across the floor , she lifted the cover of the tray to find a loaf of freshly baked bread , several thick slices of roast beef and cheese , a bowl of strawberries , and two blueberry muffins , as well as packets of honey , sugar , and cream .
and then , still thinking about flour and sugar and vanilla , she leaned over and kissed him full on the lips .
` ` whatever you want , sugar . ''
she added cream and sugar to her cup .
a flowered teapot and matching china cups sat on the coffee table , along with a batch of freshly baked sugar cookies .
she set out two mugs of coffee , along with a small bowl of sugar and a little pitcher of cream .
the resulting visions and prophecy had revealed poison in the sugar lumps she usually gave the courtyard ponies on moonsday .
she also gave them treats every workday morning - carrots or apples or , on moonsday , sugar lumps .
the only things in the kitchen area besides a jar of instant coffee and bags of herbal tea were a box of sugar lumps , a box of crackers , and a storage tin that held an open package of chocolate cookies .
she shrugged into her coat , grabbed the box of sugar lumps , then rushed to open the door , because the next chorus of neighs was now accompanied by the cawing of the crows .
then she opened the box of sugar lumps .
sighing and shivering , meg closed the door , returned the sugar to the cupboard in the back room , and continued with her work .
` ` we had sugar lumps on moonsday as a special treat .
we do n't get sugar lumps again as a treat until next moonsday , which is here . ''
all the ponies ate their carrots , including the ones who must have shown up today because they expected sugar .
` ` only that they did n't get sugar lumps today , but sugar is a special treat and is n't something they should have every day , so today the treat was carrots , and thunder ... thundered ... which upset elliot wolfgard , who sent some stuffy owl to remind me that the consulate dealt with human government and should n't be embarrassed by the courtyard help 's shenanigans ! ''

` ` you gave sugar to the ponies ? ''
an occasional lump of sugar wo n't hurt them . ''
` ` will there be sugar again ? ''
she held it up and tapped the big black s. ` ` moonsday is sugar day . ''
a box of sugar lumps sitting on a big table in the middle of the room .
the box of sugar lumps she 'd left on the sorting table was knocked over and the top of the box was torn .
she was about to ask about the sugar when asia dashed into the office .
` ` oh , the sugar is for the ponies .
` ` if someone hid a lump of sugar in order to attract bugs to eat , that someone is n't going to be allowed to play with the pencils anymore . ''
then he fluttered down to the floor , pecked around the edge of the counter for a moment , flew back up , and dropped the sugar lump on the counter .
sighing , meg took the sugar lump - and heard something fall over in the back room .
that 's when she saw the box of sugar on the table and realized she no longer had the sugar lump she 'd taken from jake and had no clue where she 'd dropped it .
that 's when she saw the box of sugar on the table and realized she no longer had the sugar lump she 'd taken from jake and had no clue where she 'd dropped it .
she did n't see the wolf pup , which was a disappointment , but she did see the box of sugar lumps on the big table .
confirmation enough that meg brought out the sugar on moonsday .
` ` and the sugar . ''
but in the cupboard under the counter , she found what she was looking for : a partially used box of sugar lumps .
the crystals did n't look any different from sugar crystals , and from what she 'd learned about this stuff , it did n't taste much different either , which is why it was so effective and the penalties for using it were so high .
she tapped crystals over the top layer of sugar lumps , then gently shook the box to coat more of the lumps .
she continued doing that until she poured the last crystals over the sugar .
putting the empty vial back in the coat pocket , she replaced the box of sugar , picked up her flashlight , and went into the next room .
for a moment , she regretted using all those crystals on the sugar , then realized it was just as well she had n't been able to give in to impulse .
box of sugar lumps .
black snakes in the sugar . ''
using the towel to avoid touching the box of sugar lumps , she dumped some of them into the jar .
she did n't want to leave the girl in the back room with the box of sugar , and she did n't think meg would want to be around simon and the others who took an interest in her until they knew why she had made the cut .
and no one should go sniffing around the box of sugar . ''
` ` there 's always sugar on moonsday , and they all come up to see meg .
someone poisoned the sugar in order to kill the ponies . ''
` ` but we 'll give him the box of sugar , let his people figure out the poison . ''
` ` we 'll put the box of sugar lumps in that .
meg ... we suspect there is something wrong with the sugar lumps that were in the back room .
the liaison usually gives the ponies sugar on moonsday as a treat , but she had a feeling something was wrong .
some of us believe the sugar was poisoned , but we do n't have a way of testing it . ''
monty put the pieces together and filled in the unspoken piece : meg , the cassandra sangue , had cut herself and saw poison in the sugar .
` ` where are the sugar lumps now ? ''
` ` meg saw enough to protect them and to warn us , but she did n't see who poisoned the sugar . ''
there should have been an uproar in the courtyard on moonsday after the ponies ate the sugar , but there had been nothing then and nothing since .
` ` someone became uneasy about the sugar and did n't give it to the ponies , '' he said .
montgomery gave me excuses , but the end result is we are n't going to know if the sugar was poisoned . ''
` ` there is another way to find out if the sugar was poisoned , '' she said .
` ` you can choose between the sugar or this . ''
he took two sugar lumps , popped them in his mouth , chewed a couple of times , and then swallowed .
as she watched him , she tapped two sugar lumps onto the floor near darrell 's chair .

we had three towns in west virginia to visit after that and the first full moon in december fell on the third one , sugar grove , which bordered the shenandoah mountains .
the full moon was nearly on us when we arrived in sugar grove two nights later , and all three wolves i traveled with were getting restless .
two hours before dawn , my three wandered toward our cabin - the sugar grove pack had already gone their separate ways .
all of the vampires went home after the remnants of the sugar grove pack had either been exterminated ( if they knew about gap 's little indiscretion ) or sent to buckhannon if they did n't .
the call i was dreading to make after the sugar grove ordeal , however , was the one to gavin .
* * * we did a whirlwind trip back to the east coast ; the werewolves of the now defunct sugar grove pack had cost us time and several visits had to be postponed so weldon , winkler and kelvin could recuperate .

annie , feeling the attention of the two police officers turn in her direction , began to fuss with the sugar and cream pot , not daring to look up .
valognes , he said , making his selection quickly and waving off the servant with sugar cubes .
he dropped a cube of sugar into his cup and held it , letting the heat warm his hands while he waited for the sugar to dissolve .

now what she wanted was a strong cup of english tea with cream and sugar and a book .
she hurried to the fire and poured two teas and put two strainers in the cup and two blocks of sugar , thankful for the sweetness and energy it would give them .
she picked up a spoon and stirred sugar in her tea , the noise loud in the silent room .
not nearly as pretty as you , but sweeter than sugar .
i used the skim evaporated milk , not the cereal milk , and i put in two packets of artificial sugar and one of regular sugar .
i used the skim evaporated milk , not the cereal milk , and i put in two packets of artificial sugar and one of regular sugar .
the pink spun sugar dissolved like sugary sand , melting from cotton wool into nothing but an overwhelming sweetness .
not noticing the amount she put into the mug , she dumped full spoons of sugar into the murky brown liquid .
jackson always commented if she put real butter on her bread or sugar in her coffee , now here she was consuming the entire contents of the refrigerator she looked around at all the open packets and frowned .
` ` how old are you , sugar ? ''
` ` just kidding , sugar .
` ` sugar , spice , and everything nice , '' piotr recited .
the children were happy to get their sugar high .
hey sugar !

mars fixed herself a cup of hot tea , her spoon hitting the sides as she furiously stirred in a teaspoon of sugar .
~*~ cream and sugar ?
it was an overcast morning , but this did nothing to hamper jims long shadow as it crawled along the squad car , his meaty hands occupied with two extra large cream and sugar coffees .
a coffee cup with cream and sugar , or left black .
and now , look at the sugar storm we find ourselves in .
she was spreading out her sugar , which she had saved , in the window , and was manifestly beginning her fly catching again , and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace .
she has the sugar of her tea spread out on the window sill , and is reaping quite a harvest of flies .
' then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way , she said , ' doctor , wo n't you be very good to me and let me have a little more sugar ?
she went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar .
the first step was to restore confidence , so i asked her , speaking pretty loud so that she would hear me through her closed ears , ' would you like some sugar to get your flies around again ? '
when we entered we saw with amazement that she had spread out her sugar as of old .
daren took the change and brought the cup of java to the cream and sugar table where a quick pour and stir happened all too quickly .
my daddy used to take a wagon down to the general store and come back with big blocks of butter and cheese along with sacks of beans , rice , potatoes , sugar , and flour .
he never made a move on me and i liked him for it , however it did make me wonder if he maybe had a little sugar in his tank .
outside of reading and writing , he is a beginning swimmer , a gym hater , an avid gardener of sugar baby melons , a lover of jokes , and a planner for the great zombie apocalypse ( it is coming , people ! ) .
lloyds market had always had a nice selection of general - store staples and the hardest - to - manufacture - at - home grocery items : flour , sugar , dried fruit , and sweet syrups .
take then ye mixture and pour an equal volume of water mixed with half as much needles of ye evergreene , and take then a cane of sugar and extract all that you may frome it and stir it all in together , making sure not to miss one droppe or graine .
we need to add half as much evergreen needles into it as well , reinhouer gestured to the bags of needles lying on the floor , and then canes of sugar .
the next step was , of course , to extract all that they could from a cane of sugar and mix that in with the rest of it being careful , of course , not to spill one droppe or graine .
the professor wrung out every last bit of sugar from the first cane , letting it fall into the powdery mixture .
mix this powder then with an equal volume of water and half as many evergreen needles , and then extract one canes worth of sugarcane sugar into the mixture .
if she were merely hyped up ava could attribute it to the sugar , but bath time was particularly trying when agitation morphed into a tantrum and a bottle of shampoo ended up squeezed flat against the wall , the liquid streaking down the tile to puddle on the floor .
they rolled out their sleeping bags in front of the fireplace and maddie snuggled in the crook of her arm and fell asleep surprisingly fast for the amount of sugar shed ingested .
there were little avenues for escape , because no matter how many public service ads went out about the dangers of junk food , the average teenager was always on the hunt for the next sugar high or salt lick .
he reached for his coffee and put two sugars in it before hesitating with the creamer .
ben looked at the little bit of sugar and grounds that had not dissolved at the bottom of the cup as if he could tell the fortunes of the day from the remains .
` ` and no sugar , '' he said after having tasted it as if he was playing a part in a commercial .
mauro betti did not flinch , he took the juice that the bartender had placed on the counter and opened a sachet of sugar .
he drained the juice and scooped up the sugar on the bottom of the glass .
i shivered pleasantly and watched the sweat on my boss bared breasts harden into ice , like a light sugar dusting .
sylvia exclaimed , all sugar and spice .
sand dusted my ankles like soft crumbly brown sugar .
the plastic bicchierino lay on the support , coffee was gone out , the palettina in soak , sugar grew thick on the fund .
well , are nt you just the sweet sugar mama ?
before paul could answer , his phone began to play the dance of the sugar plum fairywendys ringtone .
its heat scorched her face , and the air was rich with smoke and sugar .
some of the courtiers , though , were humans themselvesscattered through the crowd like bone fragments in a sugar bowl , perfumed and powdered to hide the odor of their living bodies .
the nearly full coffee urn was punctured twice and steaming hot brown liquid squirted out and splashed down on the fat reporter who had found a box of sugar cookies under the table .
the kettle whistles sharply and my mother removes it from the burner , sets it carefully down on the waiting pot holder near the sugar .
the sugar bowl was closed and the jar of herbal stuff was open right next to it .
i do n't know what happened , but who would mistake poison for sugar ? ''
a cloud of white dots gushed from the window , pouring into the sky , expanding and dispersing like sugar in tea .
my second breath was somewhat pleasant , like a mouthful of candy floss without the feeling of sugar dismantling my teeth .
anything seem to bring em on , sugar ?
ill always be here when you need me , sugar .
but seriously , sugar , how do you feel ?
i know you re trying to make light of it , sugar , but those dreams are obviously driving you nuts .
you ll have a sugar high and never sleep again .
you seem to be kinda low today , sugar .
but you ve got your own little family to concern yourself with , sugar .
oh , come on , sugar .
for a few minutes after ordering two scoops of chocolate ice cream on sugar cones , i felt whole again .
hi , sugar .
and you , sugar , have seen me through some real bad times .
i pour some of it in the mister 's favorite santa cup and take it out to him where i put two spoonfuls of sugar in it .
lance held his head in his hands , the fatigue not going away no matter how much caffeine and sugar he pumped into his body .
margot added cream and sugar substitute , and stirred .
she supposed that she could use real sugar , and her weight would not suffer for it .
her granola bars were high fibre , low fat , and reduced sugar .
yes , we were in the country , but there were still neighbours close enough if you needed some sugar or a helping hand , or maybe just a cup of coffee with the local gals .
there were three bags of pasta , less than two dozen cans of soup , one large bag of rice , eight cans of pasta sauce , seven cans of tuna , fourteen cans of fruit of various kinds , three boxes of jell - o , one bag of flour and sugar each , a small bag of brown sugar , a half box of tea , one of each of my favourite spices , and that was about it for food of the non - perishable sort .

he grunted and helped me packed my bags , more baking supplies , chocolate chips , raisins , coconuts , walnuts , flour , and sugar .
marshmallows and chocolate chips sprayed through the air , the scent of sugar drawing jessicas nose to the food stuff instead of to me .
same as usual i say with a grin while adding sugar and powdered milk to my coffee .
besides sugar that is .
colin grasped her arms , lifting her to her feet as if she weighed no more than a bag of sugar .
and heres a sugar cube for each of you .
how s your blood sugar ?
his will could crush us all ... chapter eleven max watched as joshua checked his blood sugar at the kitchen table .
in every whiff there were millions of pennies in sugar .
a little blood in the morning , and by evening a little salty and sweet to wash away all those pennies in sugar .
i shook my head condescendingly at him , ` ` you talk about it as though it 's building a castle out of sugar cubes .
i gobbled everything down , only then realizing the reparative powers of sugar .
the smell of thousands of pennies in sugar hit me , but it did not make me smile .
i breathed deep , let the sugar air fill me , and closed my eyes .
the blood was draining from me i could feel , all the sugar in my bloodstream sinking to my toes , leaving my head bare and dry .
it sat like a tiny sugar castle in the night , its white paint twinkling in the moonlight .
i thought to myself then that if this night went smoothly i was going to buy a box of sugar cubes and eat them all .
in a few short seconds , i was out of the house , walking in the night on the stiff grass , thinking of sugar cubes .
he sucks his teeth as though cleaning them of sugar .
but the mere thought of coffee without cream and sugar made her want to gag .
though full of fat and sugar and salt , it was also filled with love .
the thought of dante as a sugar daddy to this very young beauty was enough to make lucy gag .
shed wanted her father to buy it for her , the fleece was so soft , and it had licked sugar cubes out of her hand .
chapter 13 gram poured them both some homemade lemonade and set out some sugar cookies shed baked just the day before .
they were coated with pink and yellow sugar crystals , and they smelled of citrus .
his voice was laced with sugar .
she added a small spoon of sugar and stirred .
ai nt no sugar coating the deed little capone , vincent explained with an easy shrug .
it was good stuff , had cost him a bundle , but he could cut it with sugar , starch and some of his moms tea blend to stretch it and make a good profit .
she began stroking his hair comfortingly , shhh , there now , all done sugar .
as far as she was concerned she would ve been just fine sitting back in her lawn chair under the sun , sipping her long island ice tea , smoking her virginia slim lights while watching her husband mark give her bedroom eyes as he mowed the grass , and then have bbq chicken on the grill with corn on the cob and mashed potatoes and that badass sugar cream pie , and maybe just maybe her husband would fist fuck her again like he did the other night .
she set aside one of her sugar cream pies with a toothpick stuck in the middle with a small white piece of paper taped to it saying larsons .
susan cut into one of the pies she made , placing sinfully sweet and decadent triangular shapes of sugar heaven onto small plates .
big or small silly ass , heather laughed as she was pouring an excessive amount of sugar into a pitcher of cherry kool - aid .
amy was peeking just above the counter eying the flowing sugar with intensity .
angel gazed out the window watching the sun fall into the earth as no sugar tonight by the guess who played on the radio .
sweet sugar sis with that hot sugarpussy .
oh god , sugar cream pie sounds so good ri- fuck , i forgot the sugar cream pie !
oh god , sugar cream pie sounds so good ri- fuck , i forgot the sugar cream pie !

* the sweet aroma of sugar cream pie filling filled the entire downstairs area of the house as amy flew down the staircase wearing a short blue jean skirt and her tight little pink blouse she bought the other day .

when she simply nodded again , i walked into the kitchen and poured her a mug before putting some milk and sugar in there .
` ` did you put sugar in it ? ''
the coffee was decaf ; i was n't trying to make her stay up the entire night , but i wanted her to drink something hot and wanted the sugar in her system .
that monday he had n't been able to even put a coffee with three sugars together correctly , and i 'd finally sent him on a lunch , and then home when he told me isabella could n't get out of bed that morning , even with his help .
` ` the peanut butter is pure protein and sugar .
he spooned sugar into two mugs as i began to press the biscuit base into the slice pan .
when i was done and my hair dry , i pulled on my favourite silky robe from pretty plum sugar and popped a set of heated rollers in my hair .
` ` white , no sugar , '' she called back feebly .
` ` lucy told me i had to come over and borrow a cup of sugar . ''
` ` wait , '' he interrupted , ` ` i better get that cup of sugar .
i picked up an unopened bag of sugar and walked out with it clutched in my arms .
do you want the damn sugar or not ? ''
i jammed the bag of sugar at his big chest and he grabbed it before it dropped to the floor .
i watched her mix in a cream and two packets of sugar .
the two shared a kiss that left even me feeling like i 'd overdosed on sugar .
so sweet it burned , like sugar around the rim of a molotov cocktail .
i would have thought the whole food extremists would have burnt the place to the ground before allowing their children to enter a building where , no kidding , i got a sugar high just from sniffing the air .
she asked , dumping a mountain of sugar into her coffee .
` ` hey , sugar , '' she said , giving me a wide smile .
` ` lotta ... sugar .
` ` you want another , sugar ?
i need one of those slushie things to cool down , and i need the sugar before i go into hypoglycemic shock . ''
i do n't understand how you can drink it with no sugar or cream .
i did n't know what it was but he was treating me like i was spun sugar and going to break apart at any moment .
` ` sugar , looking the way you look right now , nobody in their right mind would try to stop you . ''
everywhere i touched , she was smooth and silky , and i knew she tasted like cinnamon and sugar .
` ` i know , sugar .
` ` hey , sugar , coming to see me ? ''
` ` i can play rough , sugar .
like i was a chocolate eclair , and he desperately needed a sugar fix .
my sugar rush was crashing .
i was six and happy and a little naive , eating his words up like handfuls of sugar .
she 's making cookies , and the air smells like cinnamon and nutmeg , and it reminds me of my childhood when my dad and i would sit at the table , waiting to stuff our mouths with sugar .
in fact he hates sugar and loves healthy food , mostly eating stuff that looks like rabbit food .
` ` you sound just like your father ... everything had to be referenced to sugar , '' she remarks with a frown as she sets the bowl down on the counter .
* * * we end up stopping at the local ice cream parlor , because delilah says that some sugar in my system will cheer me up .
` ` um ... '' i looked up at him as he stirred sugar into his coffee .
he moved his lips against mine , gently licked at my tongue until all i could taste was sugar and beer and nate .
a teaspoon of sugar froze over my mug .
he could have called me honey or sugar or toots or melons or bitch and he picked chippy pete ?
` ` no sugar .
midtwenties , cute , sweeter than sugar .
and i can guaran - goddamn - tee i 'll set you right for that big meeting of yours this afternoon , sugar .
` ` you lied , sugar . ''
` ` i 'll be your supplier , sugar . ''
and since a big slab of sugar and fat sounds incredibly appealing tonight , i ' m almost hoping it is her .
guess it was just the sugar talking after all .
it 's a little white triangle dusted with powdered sugar .
he dumps three more packets of sugar into his coffee and stirs .
she grabs the creamer and pulls the sugar from the cabinet .
she stares at me and then places the sugar on the table .
i grab one of the little sugar packets from the dish and slide it around the table .
kate stirs sugar into her coffee as she says it , not looking at me .
my nose was assaulted by the scent of sugar and yeast , and i was in a good mood .
handing one to jack , i said , ` ` sugar 's next to you .
as if jack could read the thoughts running through my mind about the paint , he said , ` ` it tastes like sugar , sweet like syrup .
leaning over the kitchen table , i reached for the sugar , dumping a bunch of it into my coffee .
her smile oozed sugar and syrup .
her taste was like pure sugar , and once he got a sample he was afraid he 'd be addicted .
her taste haunted him : hot and sweet and melt - in - your - mouth spun sugar .
her scent swamped him , a delicious hint of sugar and musk that rose to his nostrils and made him want to stamp and snort like a thoroughbred about to mate .
the next few hours whizzed by in a dizzying rush of children , sugar , screaming , playing , and drinking by the adults .
trystan walked back slowly , drinking his sugar quickly , when seth ran up next to him .
i ' m a tea kinda ' girl but at the risk of ruining a lovely breakfast i say , ` ` sugar and cream , please . ''
i paid my total and picked up a few things of cream and sugar at the side stand .
i started to walk off but forgot that harper would n't eat the strawberries without a little bit of sugar and threw an extra few packets in my bag .
and extra sugar !
if the stupid people around me were paying one iota of attention , they 'd see this guy for what he truly was but , instead , they immersed their heads with visions of sugar plums or whatever else people dreamed of on christmas .
if you ever need anything , an egg , cup of sugar , an inhaler - whatever - come over .
you ca n't be my sugar daddy , dawson .
we went to pinkberry and my mouth was watering , brandon thought my sugar cravings over the last few months were adorable , but i swear i turned into a crazed animal whenever i knew i was about to have some .
` ` sugar , one sec . ''
he went back to crunching on his sugar cone while i tried to get control of my body 's reaction to his intimate touch .
` ` not sure yet , sugar , '' crisis replied .
` ` how high can you jump , sugar ? ''
two creams , no sugar ? ''
he picks up a sugar cookie , scrapes the sprinkles off , and bites off the corner .
the mattress concaves beneath me as he bounces up and down like a little kid with too much sugar in their system .
tearing some packets open , he adds sugar to his coffee with unsteady hands .
she gets up and starts cleaning the house like a robot dosed up on sugar and caffeine .
` ` took you two long enough , '' she jokes as she adds a spoonful of sugar to her coffee .
maybe mix it up with sweet pea and warm vanilla sugar .
it leaves some powdered sugar on my fingers so i suck it off and then grab another one .
` ` hey , sugar tits , '' i heard someone slur from behind me while i was putting cash in the register .
i asked , deciding to ignore the sugar tits comment .
` ` thanks for the drink , sugar tits . ''
she felt even stranger that he was n't some sugar daddy that had come into money , but that he got his wealth through criminal means .
sugar sweet .
gus and i exchanged a glance as dan put on the kettle and began carrying things over to the table for us , cups , saucers , a sugar bowl , non - dairy creamer .
i walk over and open the kitchen cabinet , taking two brown sugar and cinnamon pop tarts from the box and drop them in my bag .
` ` but there 's nothing but sugar and fat in those things , '' he says , recalling our earlier conversations about junk food .
i could barely hear the musical song of the water falling over the loud screeching of sugar filled kids .
i open the lid and get treated to the scent of powdered sugar , yeast , and cinnamon .
he laughed coldly while i fumbled through getting some sugar and stirring my coffee .
she 'd been sweet as sugar to me so far , but i saw the spicier side to her personality in that one look .
you could use a little sugar , i think . ''
i stared down at mine , added one sugar , then stared some more .
i shook my head , then added another packet of sugar .
he picks up a pack of sugar from the holder and starts playing with it .
putting the sugar down , he pulls his cell from his pocket .
i have the food already on a tray , so i just add the coffee pot , cream and sugar .
i pour some sugar in my coffee .
the air was drugged with sugar and salt .
i slipped into the rhythm , let my body ride the music , vodka flooding my veins with sugar and fire .
the storm front had finally broken , tatters of cloud pulling apart like cotton candy and sprinkling the sky with the bright sugar grains of stars .
he stared at the coffee table , the reflection of snow like confectioner 's sugar sifting down .
the fumes in my throat mellowed into burnt sugar .
i stirred sugar into my cup .
i took a sip of my sugar - and - cream coffee .
come here and give me some sugar , '' she says , patting her leg .
i pour in some milk and add two scoops of sugar .
i set out sugar and cream on the counter then take a seat between asher and jack .
` ` yeah , time for you to go , sugar , '' i say , sitting up and wondering why the f**k i keep doing this to myself .
` ` with a little bit of milk and one raw sugar . ''
` ` we did n't have any raw sugar , so i added a little regular , '' he began , holding the cup out for me , ` ` but it 's my way of apologizing and begging for forgiveness . ''
i poured my coffee , added a splash of milk and packet of raw sugar , and leaned into the counter across from grandma m. she came in every saturday night and sat in the very middle barstool .
` ` touchy , '' matt muttered , adjusting his collar and tossing a sugar packet at cole 's chest .
` ` you act like a prissy bitch , you look down on the girls that want a sugar daddy , but you are just like us !
it hardly fit in with his usual dieting standards , being mostly sugar and simple carbs , but he 'd been pretty lax about that on vacation .
i waited for my coffee at the other end of the bar , and hurried away without adding my usual dribble of milk and three packets of sugar .
i removed the lid and added sugar and milk while she shook cinnamon over her latte .
with wide eyes , i take in the three martini glasses : sugar around the edges , filled with yellow liquor , a pineapple perfectly wedged on each of the rims , and a toothpick attaching a cherry on top .
i add cream and sugar .
i add my own cream and sugar .
i even splurged and got whipped cream , hoping the extra sugar would help elevate my mood .
` ` i must be more tired than i thought , '' she murmured to herself as she poured two servings of creamer and a sugar into the coffee cup .
the coffee was warm in his hands and he had surprised himself by ordering it with cream and sugar ; he usually liked it black .
her voice sung in his ears as she ordered a coffee , pausing to decide if she wanted cream and sugar .
it had become a joke in med school that you could feed him fourteen cups of coffee , a considerable amount of sugar , and probably throw in a red bull or two , and his hands would be as calm and neutral as switzerland .
the protein bar purported to be peanut butter flavored , but it tasted like a combination of wax , sugar , and something else she could n't put her finger on .
maybe if he sank into a sugar coma he could get through it .
alex threw a sugar packet at him .
` ` black with sugar .
alessandro nodded with understanding and called to elise , who was walking back into the room with sugar for rena 's coffee : ` ` she 's upset because maddy 's telling everyone that she 's seeing nick . ''
we could have met for dinner , '' dyson said and handed her a mug of hot coffee with milk but no sugar , just the way she liked it .
cream , sugar ? ''
` ` this have any sugar in it ? ''
dawson is great guy , and grey is sweet as sugar , but she 's tough , too , reminding me of des in that way .
josie groaned and threw a sugar packet at her .
laura 's turn to fling a sugar packet at josie 's head .
she then dumped a bowl of cut apples into the pan with the dough , sprinkled some sugar and cinnamon on top , then placed the dough she had already rolled out on top of the now - full pie pan .
it 's got raspberry juice , gin and sugar crystals on the rim .
that 's what the sugar daddies do for their ladies .
apparently , that 's what trophy - husbands - to - be expect from their sugar mamas too .
their coffees arrived and he stirred in a spoonful of sugar .
` ` black , one sugar , '' he growled .
when he had overloaded himself with sugar , he pushed his plate away .
i think she accidentally put salt instead of sugar this time . ''
` ` ah , like he 's on a sugar rush or something ? ''
` ` sugar , you just have a seat , and i 'll go pack up everything . ''
` ` now you listen to them , sugar .
vilma tanner 's voice was a mix of sugar and steel as she asked , ` ` will you do it ? ''
is he your sugar daddy ? ''
i was fidgeting with a sugar packet on the table top , and he grabbed my fingertips in his and stroked the top of my thumb .
nikki tapped a sugar packet thoughtfully .
it 's your big day tomorrow , and i do n't want to see you yawning up on stage during the sugar beet dance or whatever it 's called . ''
i basically looked like a very slutty sugar plum fairy .
i kissed him , enjoying the tickling sensation of the fake mustache on his upper lip , then i pulled back and performed a very unorthodox routine , half sugar plum fairy and half striptease .
` ` let 's raid the mini - bar , give me a few minutes to recuperate , and then you can do that sugar plum fairy dance again . ''
` ` mm , lollipop , '' he said , because i must have still had the sugar from the lolly on my lips .
suzanne grabbed the milk and sugar and took a seat beside me .
simon stirred the cream and sugar into his coffee .
and goodness knows there are a lot of women around looking for ` ` sugar daddies '' to buy them things in exchange for affection .
` ` i ' m not made of sugar . ''
easy on the sugar . ''
` ` robert , '' she barked , ` ` make two mojitos , no sugar . ''
` ` let them ask for the sugar .
jonathan put sugar in his coffee , smiled at me , and turned back to darren .
the break room stank of stale coffee , non - dairy creamer and sugar glaze .
` ` she thinks i ' m made of sugar . ''
` ` oo , sugar !
i bit into it and looked back at creed , saying through sugar and fried dough , ` ` coffee ? ''
coffee cups , sugar bowl , small jug of milk , butter dish , jar of strawberry jam that was not purchased from a grocery store , silver spoon in it .
then i splashed milk in my coffee , spooned in a sugar .
i 'd made this decision when a cafetiere was plonked on my table with a small elegant pitcher of cream and matching sugar bowl and another italian man , my waiter , started talking to me .
but before i could form any conclusions or , say , react at all , my entire body went rigid when i watched in sheer , unadulterated terror as the waiter moved my cafetiere , creamer , sugar bowl and coffee cup to sampson cooper 's table .
they had crumbled nutter butters in them , hot fudge she made that had two sticks of butter and half a bag of sugar in it and my mother actually wrote to a frozen yogurt manufacturer once to request them to provide her with the knowledge of what was the point so , suffice it to say , the ice cream would be premium .
he 's sugar sweet to her and it freaks me out .
` ` he let us get the ones we wanted , '' billy informed me and i looked at him to see he had powdered sugar down the front of the new tee he was wearing .
in about five minutes they 're each gon na have a sugar crash and lapse into donut comas .
at his words , forgetting my audience , i stared at his handsome profile as he grabbed a spoon from the drawer and then reached out to the sugar bowl .
` ` no need , she was cool , '' mitch answered , spooning sugar into the milky mugs .
` ` i see this shit shook out some sass in you , babe , my tess was sugar sweet from the minute my eyes hit her to the minute i kissed her goodnight .
looks like that and sugar sweet , '' he muttered then went on to say , ` ` turns out saccharine . ''
his eyes got intense and he said softly , ` ` not my place , lost that place and i ' spect you know it but i ' m gon na say it anyway and i hope you know i got my son 's best interests at heart but , like olivia , you are far from hard on the eyes and , like olivia , you 're sugar sweet and i need you now , tess , to promise me what 's under all that frosting , '' he jerked his chin at me , ` ` tastes just as sweet . ''
` ` only two things better in the whole world than your frosted sugar cookies with daisy sprinkles and those are pigs in a blanket and a man with a fine package .
` ` you got that right , sugar , '' daisy matched her mutter .
` ` you got that right , sugar , '' daisy whispered .
` ` make that a frosted sugar cookie with daisy sprinkles and i just found me a mission , '' shirleen stated and i nodded to her .
i did unearth my fancy - shmancy coffee service and the cups with saucers , filled up the sugar bowl and creamer , set it all on a tray and carried it back .
she 'd already finished a tray and they were lightly dusted with cocoa powder and showered with orange - flavored sugar and chocolate sprinkles .
kellie called , hands busy with rolling snickerdoodle balls of dough in cinnamon and sugar .
but i have to tell you , tess , i ' m uncertain about injecting even a teaspoon of sugar into those four .
with sugar in them , they might explode through like four year old little girl hulks in mermaid outfits . ''
* * * * * the cops were gone , laura and the girls were gone and the boys were back to kp duties , albeit doing it with far less enthusiasm and this was because their minds were filled with their mother 's antics but also because wiping down tables and cleaning dishes had lost its luster ( as it had a tendency to do , no matter what age you were ) and i was in the back , icing sugar cookies when my phone on the stainless steel table rang .
* * * * * ` ` you got sugar cookies with daisy sprinkles on the menu tomorrow ? ''
although she 'd been given my cell number by someone and i 'd received and returned a variety of texts from her , mostly about sugar cookies , nightie requirements and the upcoming girls ' night in , i did n't know her very well mainly because we 'd conversed solely about sugar cookies , nightie requirements and girls ' night in .

you 're made of sugar , tess , and it 's a given you 'd eventually get it good because people like you , sweet to the core , they deserve it .
` ` cream , half a sugar . ''
` ` half a sugar ? ''
` ` i save my sugar for when i eat it in cookie dough . ''
chocolate chip or sugar cookie . ''
- this a thought i relayed to him prior to his call to the commandos ) , eggs , bacon , lunchmeat , bread , a variety of chips , two rolls of chocolate chip cookie dough , two of sugar cookie dough and a plethora of condiments .
` ` milk and half a sugar , '' i replied quickly .
` ` half a sugar wo n't help that ass , '' gus observed helpfully and hawk 's body started shaking and i knew he was silently laughing but that was when maria turned swiftly , reached up , grabbed a mug and threw it at gus .
tack was flipping pancakes , he finished this task , reached into a cupboard and pulled out a half full bag of sugar , putting it down by my mug .
i searched for spoons , sloshed in milk , did my sugar , put back the milk and stirred .
` ` hard for two bitches to get their mouths wrapped around my cock , but if you ' ve got a way , sugar , i ' m up for the experience . ''
when she did n't , gently , he prompted , ` ` i kinda need to know where that bathroom is , sugar . ''
through a grin , he advised , ` ` you may be drinking direct , sugar , but you still got ta drink smart . ''
` ` tabby , sugar , your dad part - owns the most kick - ass garage this side of the mississippi and most of the other side , and you 're paying for oil changes ? ''
` ` i know , sugar , '' he whispered to the ceiling .
he pulled their hands up the bed and shifted slightly closer before he said gently , ` ` if he was in this room right now , sugar , right now , he would n't want this .
` ` cherry said you felt shit , sugar .
through his grin , he noted , ` ` that about covers it , sugar . ''
` ` yeah , sugar , works for me , '' he muttered , and i did n't bury in my pit of denial how much i liked it when he called me ` ` sugar . ''
` ` yeah , sugar , works for me , '' he muttered , and i did n't bury in my pit of denial how much i liked it when he called me ` ` sugar . ''
* * * ` ` sugar , you awake ? ''
` ` you did n't have the time to print out the papers but , sugar , you did that shit all the same . ''
` ` you got two hours , sugar , then you come to me , '' shy demanded .
` ` got your head sorted , sugar ? ''
but sayin ' that , sugar '' -his voice dropped- '' what just happened was somethin ' that was bigger than all that .
his face got close and he continued , ` ` i was young , pissed , and stupid , sugar .
` ` sugar , look at me , '' shy ordered gently , and i opened my eyes .
` ` he just survived afghanistan , sugar , do n't think he needs to come home and have you kill him with your cooking . ''
` ` sugar , you 'll be good , '' he assured me .
` ` jesus , sugar , you got ta quit comin ' so fast .
` ` though , sayin ' that , sugar , none of them are cokeheads with a life complex , so at least we got that going for us . ''
shy was silent a moment , his arms tight around me , then he murmured , ` ` i 'll give you that , sugar . ''
she had n't called and she did n't pick up any of my calls or return any of my messages , but when i expressed my concern to shy , he just said , ` ` keep tellin ' you , sugar , she 'll come back to you .
` ` be back , sugar . ''
` ` there 's no reason for that , sugar .
` ` did what , sugar ? ''
` ` how you wan na play this , sugar ? ''
` ` all right , sugar , but like i said , i do n't do laundry . ''
` ` yeah , sugar , you 'd also go to bed alone with no one to eat your pu**y , '' he retorted .
` ` expanding ride , sugar .
` ` though , sugar , i ' m ready for you to climb on , you swing astride me .
i put it to my ear and within a ring , i heard shy 's , ` ` sugar . ''
coupla days before your period , sugar , you can get bitchy .
but , sugar , in future , i 'll have a lot less patience with you goin ' into your head and keepin ' shit from me .
minutes slid by as this settled deep before shy called , ` ` sugar ? ''
` ` well , you did n't think right , sugar .
` ` i get it , sugar .
` ` my mom and dad both worked , sugar , '' he told me , lying on top of me on the living room floor , still inside me , his thumb tracing my hairline .
` ` i know you lost it all right before the big event , sugar , and you said you were n't gon na do it again .
` ` right here , sugar . ''
` ` tabby , sugar , i ' m fine . ''
` ` wiped , sugar , '' he muttered .
` ` good job , sugar .
seen you cacklin ' with sheila , who 's sweet as sugar , but that do n't mean she 'd take shit from any man .
and not sayin ' mitzi pulled the wool over my eyes bein ' sugar sweet .
my guess was they 'd win seeing as hop had given them what he promised , and they were both currently burning through the sugar high to end all sugar highs .
my guess was they 'd win seeing as hop had given them what he promised , and they were both currently burning through the sugar high to end all sugar highs .
since i did n't have time , i cheated on the key lime pie and made the pie my grandmother taught me how to make , ` ` when you 're in a pinch , sugar plum . ''
` ` one sugar . ''
then he pulled out a huge , unopened bag of sugar and , if i was n't wrong , i bought that bag in denver too .
i opened the bag of sugar while i said , ` ` i do n't think i could do bacon . ''
i spooned sugar in my coffee and then i stared at the gallon jug of milk .
he 'd put the milk back in the fridge and walked back to me , grabbing the bag of sugar , his eyes came to me before he turned toward the oatmeal .
then i watched as he spooned sugar in the oatmeal .
` ` oatmeal with one sugar or satisfy your hankerin ' for some toast with grape jelly ? ''
he poured coffee in a mug , spooned in a sugar and went to the fridge , pulling out the milk then he said , ` ` i want you to come with me to the bluff . ''
he turned to the coffeepot , poured another mug , black , no sugar , sipped it and slid some more bread in the toaster .
then i spooned in some sugar .
max was oblivious , i knew this because he turned to mindy and asked , ` ` you take cream or sugar ? ''
` ` lotsa milk , two sugars , '' mindy ordered and i moved to make her coffee mainly because this would give me something to do , something that had nothing to do with me inflicting bodily harm .
max made a show of reaching into the cupboard for sugar , hiding me from jeff , mick and mindy but when his hand came down with the bag of sugar , his mouth went to my ear .
max made a show of reaching into the cupboard for sugar , hiding me from jeff , mick and mindy but when his hand came down with the bag of sugar , his mouth went to my ear .
` ` black , sugar , one spoon 'll do , '' he replied .
then i sorted my shopping , clipping off the tags , putting things away then i grabbed the cream and sugar bowl i 'd found in town .
they were handmade , fantastic pottery by a local artisan , larger than normal creamers and sugar bowls , unusual squat shapes with equally unusual twisting handles and they were glazed cream at the top and inside , terra cotta at the bottom .
he did n't need a creamer and sugar bowl , probably would never use them , but they sure would look good in his kitchen .
therefore i took them to his kitchen , cleaned them , dried them and filled them , leaving the small milk jug in the fridge and putting the sugar bowl by the coffeepot .
because when that man gets something in his head - '' i was watching max who 'd taken down some mugs and just spied the new sugar bowl .
` ` and a sugar bowl . ''
then i looked at him and said , ` ` yes , agreed , this ring is a whole lot better than a little pitcher even with a matching sugar bowl . ''
` ` i ' m sorry , nina , this 'll only take a minute , '' shauna said , having decided that she was not a cold , heartless , cheating , she bitch from hell but , tonight , she was sugar sweet on the surface , however still unsuccessfully hiding the heartless , cheating , she bitch from hell she was to her core .
` ` harry - '' shauna was back to her fake sugar sweet pleading tone .
` ` max , i like that sugar bowl and creamer , saw it in town , almost picked them up for myself , '' linda noted .
creamer and sugar bowl .
` ` fran , nina needs a skinny latte , max wants an americano , black , and jeff needs a to go americano , cream and one sugar .
` ` anyway , jeff , seems to me , unless this winston fella finds himself a sugar mama , his wife gets pissed , which she is , she takes it all . ''
it was then mindy entered the conversation and suggested to jeff , ` ` maybe a sugar mama who thought she was going to inherit some , or all , of a local big man 's construction empire because she told him she was pregnant with his child ? ''
` ` milk and sugar , '' i answered .
i turned to my buds at the pool table and shouted , ` ` i ' m off to dinner with my sugar daddy !
on top of the built - in there was an electric kettle , two huge coffee mugs with colorful swirls on them sitting next to a matching sugar bowl and a creamer with a jar of instant coffee next to that and two teaspoons .
there were also two , brightly striped tea towels in colors that matched the cups and the sugar bowl was filled .
she made these cookies , like crescent rolls but in cookie form with lots of cinnamon and sugar and butter and the dough was made with sour cream so they were rich and she sifted powdered sugar on them .
she made these cookies , like crescent rolls but in cookie form with lots of cinnamon and sugar and butter and the dough was made with sour cream so they were rich and she sifted powdered sugar on them .
she let me brush the melted butter on the rolled out dough and sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar on and she let me sift the powdered sugar on top . ''
she let me brush the melted butter on the rolled out dough and sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar on and she let me sift the powdered sugar on top . ''
` ` jesus , ace , that 's like suckin ' back a mouthful of sugar . ''
i went to the cupboard , pulled down mugs , went to the fridge , got the milk , slid the sugar across the counter away from the wall .
i was holding onto my dad , feeling his healing arms around me but i heard mom say , ` ` tate , hon , give jeannie some sugar . ''
if mom was talking in third person and asking for sugar , she was back .
` ` hi jonas , i ' m gramma , '' she announced then demanded , ` ` give me some sugar . ''
she went from spooning sugar into her coffee to looking at him .
she went back to spooning sugar in but she did it nodding .
a whole set of brand new , stylish , expensive stoneware including serving platters , bowls , creamer and sugar , the whole enchilada .
then i went to the cupboard , found the sugar bowl and creamer and set those at an angle opposite the frame in the windowsill .
then i set the treasure island snow globe in the middle of the deep sill over the kitchen sink where the picture was angled in a corner and the sugar and creamer in the other .
i , of course , on a lunch break bought the big , round , glass vase i had my eye on at the carnal country store and the proprietress thanked me profusely for buying it saying , ` ` sugar , that thing has been on my shelf for a year and a half .
he looked over his shoulder at the man even as he reached for the sugar .
i looked into the display and ordered a blueberry muffin with brown sugar crumbles on top .
i get up in the mornin ' ready to make coffee , you not only got the coffee made , babe , you ' ve pulled down a mug and put sugar in it for me .
mick poured and slid the sugar reece 's way .
` ` what 's the password then , sugar tits ? ''
` ` did you just call her sugar tits ? ''
` ` well , she has nice tits and she looks as sweet as sugar , so yeah .
` ` where 's sugar tits ? ''
a grey cloud fell like icing sugar , and my heart went from dead to thudding like crazy .
if your intention was to make me ( an unknown stranger who could be your mother - in - law or an arthritic eighty - year - old ) wet and patient , perhaps you could bribe me with sugar , a hot bath , and a night off from work - then perhaps i 'll obey and ' deserve ' your veiled insinuation of pleasure .
i 'd never gone this long without food , and the lack of sugars and vitamins faded the edges of my vision .
i spanned my arm , encompassing the pretty lounger , lace umbrella , and side table complete with a carafe of tart cranberry juice and sugar crystals .
why did the demon of my nightmares smell of innocence and sugar ?
the bushy vegetation canopied a boardwalk which lay beneath a fine lashing of icing sugar sand .
` ` i 'll have cream and sugar , '' he said .
filling a cup with sugar , milk and coffee , david turned back to paul .
while lily was baking some sugar cookies and mince pies , wayne took the kids out into the yard to make a snowman .
she got a cup ready with some milk , sugar and a tea bag , then buttered herself some bread for a sandwich and went and sat at the table .
vanilla and icing sugar . ''

by seven that morning he had had two pots of strong coffee , a box of stale doughnuts he found in the back of the kitchen cabinet while looking for some sugar , and was ready to call it a day .
jeffs lips moved slightly as he made an effort not to smile before he continued , but before you do , i like my coffee strong and black with no sugar or cream .
her mouth watered just looking at the sugar donuts .
she seems so down to earth , maureen said as she stirred sugar into her tea , feigning indifference , but seeming really curious .
sandra spooned sugar into her tea and handed the sugar bowl to mia .
sandra spooned sugar into her tea and handed the sugar bowl to mia .
mia loved sugar in her tea but stopped using it more than a year ago , around the time she put on a few extra pounds .
there s powdered sugar as well as cinnamon and cocoa down there .
sean shrugged and loaded his snack with powdered sugar .
across from him , mia added a dusting of sugar and then cinnamon to her own before she tore off a tiny piece and popped it in her mouth .
when she darted her tongue out to lick the sugar from her fingers , his eyes followed , unable to look away .
he could nt watch her tongue licking sugar off her fingers again .
the memory of eating fried dough covered with cinnamon and sugar came to the forefront of her mind .
and the sugar is next to the muffin pans .
she asked as she added sugar to her coffee .
its hazelnut made with nonfat milk minus the whip cream and sugar .
he scooped eggs and sausage onto the toast , sprinkled a spoonful of sugar over it , and mashed it together .
you had better stop biting that lip , sugar .
the whistling stopped and moments later , he carried a tray with coffee , milk and sugar into the room .
more money left her hands to buy a ticket back to the village where she planned to stock up on flour , butter , eggs , milk , sugar , ground almonds and raisins .
cathy , sugar , do nt ever say that again , that you re unlovable .
while she was pouring herself a cup of the steaming hot liquid and rummaging for sugar in the bowl , one of her colleagues walked in , eyebrows raised .
nadia managed a half - hearted grin and decided to drink her coffee without sugar , adding some extra milk .
marquez was a tall , skinny mexican man with greasy , black hair who smelled distinctly of sugar cane .
she found some apples in the refrigerator too , and had sliced and baked them with cinnamon and sugar for dessert .
the taste made her eyes water , so she followed missys example and poured in three packets of sugar .
the next half hour went quickly with katryn showing them , using sugar packets in place of players , how it would work .
savannah watched her mother move with grace around the small roomreaching up to retrieve dainty tea cups , preparing the tea bags , pouring sugar into the porcelain serving container .
she poured the coffee , then whipped around to ask him if he wanted cream or sugar .
i assume coffee with no sugar , french vanilla on the creamer ?
do i look like a no sugar , one creamer person or something ?
laura complied , sitting across from alice , coffee with no sugar , one french vanilla creamer in a large mug in hand .
just as alice and the kids departed , doris showed up with mugs of fresh coffee for the adults , poking a little fun at laura with her no sugar , one french vanilla creamer , if you please line .
the sugar and tea had done their work , and the competitors retook their seats for the show .
one with french vanilla creamer and no sugar , one with no creamer but two sugars , and you , missy , do nt look like you re old enough to drink coffee yet .
one with french vanilla creamer and no sugar , one with no creamer but two sugars , and you , missy , do nt look like you re old enough to drink coffee yet .
` ` brown sugar and cream , the way you like it . ''
as the coffeemaker sputtered and spit the brew into the carafe , she filled a sugar bowl and milk pitcher .
um , cream and sugar .
he d moved the cream and sugar to the oak - veneer coffee table and , showing a level of comfort she envied , picked up a spoon and fixed his brew the way he preferred .
milk and sugar .
i got you cream and sugar .
we also have a fruit cup for dessert and a sugar - free fruit crumble .
she stirs sugar in her coffee .
` ` just you wait and see , my little sugar bun . ''
give me milk , give me sugar , give me sunshine !
asked suzie , playing with the sugar lumps .
said suzie , still playing with the sugar .
i ve put loads too much sugar in this , its revolting now . ''
she shook her head just as ricky knocked the sugar bowl off the work surface with an action man .
` ` i suppose this is where i say ' oh sugar ! '
but then she just could nt be bothered with any of it , and the minute she saw the grey lizard flicking into the staff kitchen to count the sugar lumps , she just grabbed the files and ran .
each curiously unappealing tray bore a cup and saucer containing strong bitter coffee , a handful of plastic - wrapped milk portions , paper - wrapped sugar , plastic , transparent - wrapped spoon and plastic - wrapped speculoos biscuits .
` ` gateau royal with sugar frosting and raspberry coulis , actually . ''
she took a sip of hers , and the tea was so sweet she felt her teeth floating in sugar .
- it was centre of ananas and sugar cane plantations .
yes , this batch was just fine , but a smattering of red or blue sugar pearl sprinkles would help the cupcakes stand out even more .
for a second she admired the array of cupcakes sporting their perky blue buttons of sugar .
should n't have this much sugar in the morning , she thought , knowing she 'd have to be careful with what she ate the rest of the day .
she was nt able to wear her favorite perfume , as some of the cats were allergic to what was considered a harsh aroma , even though it smelled like freshly baked sugar cookies .
a longing glance at the remaining cupcakes tempted her to stay longer and indulge her sugar craving .
before bedtime , she 'd baked two batches of brownies and when she tasted them , she was nt sure which recipe to use , although she was leaning toward the one that contained brown sugar instead of the brown and white sugar blend .
she put the margarine , flour , sugar , and synthetic flavorings into the endless maw of the steel mixing bowl and felt the revulsion of the sameness of each batch .
she pulled the two pans of brownies out of the cabinet and was tempted to taste them but knew not to have that amount of sugar and caffeine as a breakfast treat .
she quickly placed the cut brownies into separate containers with different colored lids so she 'd know which had the brown sugar and which had the brown and white sugar .
she quickly placed the cut brownies into separate containers with different colored lids so she 'd know which had the brown sugar and which had the brown and white sugar .
red side is white and brown sugar , blue side is brown sugar . ''
red side is white and brown sugar , blue side is brown sugar . ''
inside the sleek concrete floored caf , the aroma of perking coffee awakened her nose along with the happy accompanying scents of cinnamon , chocolate , sweet sugar and earthy spices .
enough sugar and caffeine coursed through her system so she decided to get something neutral .
what brand of flour and sugar would she stock ?
how many fifty - pound bags of flour and sugar would she need to order ?
after the first dainty spoonful , she smiled , enjoying the rush of sugar that was flooding her mouth , as though awakening it .
jeannie nodded and looked at the colorful array of cookies , many of them wearing brilliant sanding sugar coats .
ingredients : 1/2 cup [ 1 stick ] butter , melted and cooled 1 cup brown sugar 2 eggs [ room temperature ] 1/4 cup [ 2 ounces ] dark chocolate , melted , cooled slightly 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup all - purpose flour instructions : preheat oven to 325 degrees .
in a large bowl , beat butter and sugar until combined .
note : if you use part white sugar and part brown sugar , your brownies will be lighter in color and the top is more likely to crack .

now , clasped round the golden box of mints grains of sugar .
spun sugar tastes the same regardless of name . ''
no sugar , please . ''
i just offered alec daniels taffy like he was a five - year - old in need of a sugar rush .
` ` too much sugar . ''
plus , i had the biggest sugar high .
` ` sugar , salt , carbs , and caffeine . ''

are you okay , sugar ?
i would nt be able to remember my own name with her staring up at me from the front row , like a lollypop in the window of a candy store , when i d sworn off sugar .
maybe her bubble gum demeanor was sugar free .
but something told me heather would nt understand that , even if i fed it to her with a spoonful of sugar .
her eyes widened , and the sugar glaze coating them cracked just a little .
noah brushed a sprinkling of spilled powdered sugar from the coffee table onto the empty paper plate , and i got the feeling he was avoiding eye contact .
in fact , i d been thinking so clearly when i d accepted tylers cup that i d tasted it to screen not just for alcohol , but for sugar .
i stir some sugar into my coffee and sit at our table .
we ve been trying to cut back on the sugar , but just for tonight , i guess its okay , dick says with a shake of his head and a smile .
it measures the amount of sugar in the grapes and gives me a fair idea of maturity .
measures the sugar content of the grape she watched as he first tasted a grape and made several faces that she could nt interpret .
helps measure the sugar content of the grape to estimate the alcohol content ah she blew a strand of hair off her face with a weary breath .
jessi added sugar to her coffee and stirred slowly , her eyes twinkling .
she can take sugar .
wes , why do nt you go saddle sugar for chelsea ?
the gigantic dappled gray one shed heard garrett call duke , and a smaller white mare with a handful of black spots on her rump , who had to be sugar .
she squeezed , and sugar shot forward into a trot , causing chelsea to bounce up and down until her teeth rattled .
but sugar sidestepped and she felt herself falling .
shed probably taste just like sugar .
she spotted sugar when she was almost all the way to the other end of the long , narrow building .
behind him were sugar , whose rump bore charred spots , and paint , dancing and kicking wildly .
where s sugar ?
she liked coffee , but not without sugar and at least milk .
place two teaspoons of sugar , eight mint leaves and a little club soda into a highball glass .
stir well to release the sugar and mint flavor .
first , rim a martini glass with sugar .
apply that notch around the edge of the glass , and go as far down as you want the rim of sugar to go .
grab a bowl of sugar and rim the glass with sugar by rolling the glass in the sugar bowl .

grab a bowl of sugar and rim the glass with sugar by rolling the glass in the sugar bowl .
finally , add 1/2 an ounce of simple syrup ( an easy concoction to make by boiling water and adding sugar together in equal parts ) .
there was also hot butter rum and mulled wine , which was red wine with sugar and lots of spices .
top it with whipped cream and garnish with sugar sprinkles on top .
gradually add 1 cup of sugar , 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract , and 1/4 of a teaspoon of ground nutmeg as you continue beating .
mulled wine - combine one bottle of red wine , 1 cup of cognac , 3/4 of a cup of sugar , 2 cinnamon sticks , 3 whole cloves , 1 teaspoon of grated nutmeg , 1 vanilla bean , 1 star anise , 1 sliced orange , and 1 sliced lemon into a sauce pan and simmer for twenty - five minutes .
needs cream and sugar .
no more sugar for you .
i m buzzing from the sugar rush when derek edges closer to me and sets his fork on the plate , signaling he s done .
i dump most of the sugar bottle into my coffee while derek watches with quiet amusement , and i blush when i realize what a complete sugar whore i look like .
i dump most of the sugar bottle into my coffee while derek watches with quiet amusement , and i blush when i realize what a complete sugar whore i look like .
he s still staring as he streams sugar for a few seconds into his cup and stirs slowly , like he s mixing explosives .
my inner bitterness dissolves when derek slips a few ones under the sugar and stands .
where you from , sugar ?
get some deep - fat - fried sugar bombs and some java into you , sweetheart .
they arrive , and he pours a long white stream of sugar into his , followed by an ocean of cream .
i live for the sugar rush of a one - pound bag of m & ms .
what s the matter , sugar ?
what s wrong , sugar ?
its been two years , sugar .
desperate for a sugar fix , i popped open the glove box and dug around for a jolly rancher .
suppressing my feminine curiosity , i remembered my interrupted sugar fix .
instead , i groped behind the seat , blindly rummaging through the seat pocket until i found my open package of sugar babies .
i needed sugar .
we walked arm - in - arm through the front door , and i hoped that little quease in my belly was from sugar overload and not ominous premonition .
but even mango sugar could nt dispel my concerns .
like after i downed a whole 10 - pack of pixy stix in ten minutes and my blood turned to sugar water .
serious situations call for serious sugar .
giving the sugar a chance to work , i waited as long as i could to answer .
even willing the sugar into action did nt work .
i swirled a sugar cube into my tea with a spoon , too emotionally tired to look him in the eyes .
i resolutely stirred the coffee until the sugar melted into the steaming drink .
you know it was nt , sugar .
hey sugar , what s shakin ?
its not just a day listen , sugar .
maybe i was nt the only one needing to cut back on the sugar intake .
he had rolled over and reached under the bed to pull out a brown paper bag with sugar and spice imprinted in vibrant red .
still , my sugar consumption was at an all - time low , and i wassurprisinglyinvigorated .
where does this list get us , sugar ?
she reached for a teaspoon of sugar .
she added the sugar to the eggs .
it was as if he was reaching for a cup of sugar across the table .
and the world did find their precious jewel , as hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world flocked to this little town each year , just to feast their eyes on their exotic lake and the serene beauty that seemed to enchant the eyes , be it in summer when the flowers all bloomed to their full beauty like a maiden ready for her lover to come and pluck her , winter when the whole town transformed into a winter wonderland , including the peaks of the mountains with a casting of white icing sugar , spring when the buds of plants called out to the bees to collect their nectar , or autumn with the golden - yellow leaves carpeting the entire floor , making the whole town look like the land of gold glitter in the autumn sun .
i thought the sugar might help , hunter said , eyeing clarice , wondering why she was so intent on staring at the linoleum .
` ` black , one sugar .
here you are , dear , mrs . collins said with a smile , just cream , no sugar , is that right ?
brown sugar cinnamon pop - tarts .
penelope puts no - spoil creamer , sugar , and napkins in the center of the table .
the house smelled sweet , like burnt sugar or vanilla air freshener with the lingering faint traces of something that smelled like cat urine .
do you know how much sugar is in one of those things ?
sliding the french toast onto a plate , she topped it with the sliced berries and sprinkled on powdered sugar .
i should ve just stuck with the water , but i needed a little sugar .
we were having cupcakes , and even though i did nt have sugar in the cart , i was planning on using plenty of it .
i placed the necessary butter and sugar in the mixer and let it beat until they were nice and fluffy .
i got a little saucepan out and put some ketchup , spicy mustard , brown sugar and a few choice spices in it , and stirred the concoction together while i turned the stove on to medium heat .
his were overloaded with toppings and gave me a sugar rush just looking at them .
he smiled that wicked smile of his and took a handful of colored sugar and threw it back at me .
after having breakfasts of grab - and - go bars , a fried dough sugar fix hit the spot .
not being able to come up with anything better , i headed to the kitchen to make sugar cookies .
when that was done , i beat in some sugar until it reached a smooth consistency .
before you came today , i was going to make some colored sugar up , but i do nt think i can trust you not to start throwing it around .
after being surrounded by sugar for the last couple of hours , a salad was sounding really good to me .
i was surprised no one stared at me as my body rejoiced the addition of something not full of sugar .
i made my pecan chicken with a brown sugar , mustard and butter glaze as your main dish .
they ve been buying from you forever , i replied , licking the powdered sugar off my fingers .
granny and i were sharing a porch swing and a plate of sugar cookies , munching , watching the squirrels dart around the oaks and pines .
what is it you need , sugar ?
jenny was testing bubblegum flavored toothpaste that had the consistency and sugar content of corn syrup .
in home nows health advisor advised producers not to carry it unless the manufacturer eliminated the sugar content to make it less tasty .
as it did every year between late spring and summer , a super thin layer of pine pollen dusted the surface of everything , like pale yellow powdered sugar sprinkled through a sifter from above .
if sugar if ren but tully knew she could nt hope for anything from ren .
behind the town , copper mountain was in some places as white as a pile of powdered sugar and in others as blue as mist , and there was a strong wind blowing up there .
most of her life , shed disdained her given name and called herself sugar , and it was nt because she herself was especially sweet .
tully went into the store , thinking about all the other things sugar had a weakness for , and wondering if this forgiveness idea was completely crazy .
shed come for mom , not for sugar .
but sugar was the one who liked candy .
round chocolates with a tiny sugar rose in the center or heart - shaped ones covered in shiny foil the color of prom dresses or bridesmaids gowns .
tully was sure she ought to know , but she had come home to marietta so rarely since shed left so suddenly at eighteen , and never when sugar was in residence .
he d died suddenly of heart failure , and sugar had said she was coming , had given her flight details , but then shed supposedly had a fender bender on the way to the airport and shed called and said through soggy tears that she was nt going to get here in time .
this was not about her own worshipful love affair with all things chocolate , it was about finding a gift for sugar , and she might as well be generous if this forgiveness thing was going to get off the ground .
did sugar have the kind of palate that would appreciate chocolate like this ?
how much are you worth to me , sugar ?
what , she was actually going to choose a candy assortment for sugar piece by piece , as if it mattered ?
thinking of the teenage cave made her think of sugar and her erratic periods of residence during those years , when tully would spend most of her time in this bedroom , hiding from the chaos and misery sugar created .
thinking of the teenage cave made her think of sugar and her erratic periods of residence during those years , when tully would spend most of her time in this bedroom , hiding from the chaos and misery sugar created .
pushed to the margins , just like tully was whenever sugar was around , if for different reasons .
and sugar feels bad about that .
she shepherded sugar into the house and sat her down on the couch in the living room while tully was still on the stairs .
too far , sugar said .
she looked so thin and fragile and prematurely aged , and yet in many ways better than she had the last time tully had seen her , which was one horrible occasion in los angeles about ten years ago when sugar had been using heavily and practically living on the streets .
for the first time , tully found herself able to believe that sugar really was clean and drug - free , apart from the prescription pain medication she needed .
right up until the day before , she was looking forward to the whole thing without a cloud on her horizon , but then sugar turned up and tully knew the moment she heard her older sisters voice coming from the kitchen when she let herself in the front door after school that prom was spoiled now .
she hated sugar .
her name was really suzanne but she refused to go by that , and mom played along , always called her sugar , despite it being a stupid name .
tullys older brother david had gone away to college six years ago and only came home to visit once or twice a year , and she knew it was because of sugar .
tully still missed her brother like crazy and hated sugar all the more for driving him away .
right now , sugar did nt look as if she was remotely clean .
tully knew this from experience , because sugar had come back home to try to clean herself up many times before .
they d wake up one morning and sugar would be gone again and there d be a note .
tully honestly did nt know if sugar believed her own stories or what .
shed been difficult from the moment she was born , apparently , which was why mom and dad had nt had david until sugar was eight years old , and tully six years after that .
shed been bratty the whole conversation and if it had been anyone other than sugar she was being this rude to , mom would nt have let her get away with it , but mom knew .
knew that sugar should have been called vinegar instead .
writing the letters was almost fun , until sugar went outside to chain - smokebecause , you know , it would be a shame to try to break all your addictions at once , right ? and the smoke rose up through tullys open bedroom window , along with a bout of tar - filled coughing that did not sound very healthy at all .
but it did crease she decided to protect it beneath the iron by using a damp but pristine dishtowel on top of the fabric and went to the kitchen to get one , and on her way back , she heard sugar swearing .
sugar had put a mug of coffee down on the ironing board , right on the silk , and then shed bumped the feet of the ironing board and the coffee had spilled .
i ve come all this way to see my baby girl going to her prom and sugar !
but there had been all those blocks of time when sugar disappeared for months or even years on end , and when she was here , tully worked so hard at avoiding her , tuning her out .
maybe sugar had made slips before and tully had never noticed .
they d been living in san diego before tully was born , and sugar had been sneaking out , in all sorts of trouble , abusing her body already .
so tullys mom and dad were actually her grandparents , and her father was some horrible sleazy shit of a guy who d slept with sugar when she was thirteen years old .
she hated mom and dad for lying to her , even though they said they d done it for her and for sugar , and okay , sugar had been a child herself then , but she was nt a child now , and shed turned tullys whole life story inside out with one spilled mug of coffee on a precious dress that tully knew now she would never wear .
she hated mom and dad for lying to her , even though they said they d done it for her and for sugar , and okay , sugar had been a child herself then , but she was nt a child now , and shed turned tullys whole life story inside out with one spilled mug of coffee on a precious dress that tully knew now she would never wear .
go , sugar , okay , for a while ?
tully demanded , without even waiting till sugar had gone , although she was already on the way .
tully could only wonder what sugar would spend the money on .
i know , to protect sugar , to give her a second chance , that s obvious , but what about protecting me ?
because sugar was their daughter , and tully was their grand - daughter , one generation removed .
she liked that he was steady and clever and responsible and good , nothing like sugar .
but sugar never got clean .
no , i m mad at sugar .
chapter eight oh , wow , said sugar .
tully and sugar usually felt differently , and mom knew it .
the old , messed up , wired high sugar would nt have picked up on the revulsion , or would nt have cared .
this new , clean , worn - out sugar knew a little about wanting and holding back , and kept clear of tullys space .
tully handed the candy around and mom shook her head at first , but then sugar said , join us .
there was a pyramid of four hazelnuts inside each candy , resting like a miniature sculpture on a plinth of brittle , splintery caramelized sugar .
which left tully and sugar alone in a room together for the first time in nearly eighteen years .
when had that kind of self - discipline ever worked for sugar before ?
tully meant it as a barb , but sugar did nt hear it that way .
no , you should leave it right here on the table where we can see it , sugar said .
she sat where sugar had indicated and they both kicked off their shoes and scrunched their legs up .
score another point for sage , said sugar .
they were such simple things , watching an old movie and tasting chocolate together , but she never would have believed even those things were possible , back when sugar was such a crazy , delinquent mess .
mom had put a bell by sugars bed , because sometimes sugar needed to get up in the night and it was too painful for both tully and mom to hear her moving so slowly , trying to manage her pain medication on her own without waking anyone else .
mom had put a bell by sugars bed , because sometimes sugar needed to get up in the night and it was too painful for both tully and mom to hear her moving so slowly , trying to manage her pain medication on her own without waking anyone else .
tully had then ordered sugar to wake her instead , so mom could sleep , but she suspected that the bell woke mom anyhow , and she probably did nt manage to get back to sleep for a long time .
now , sugar lay back on the couch and closed her eyes , and tully thought mom would go directly upstairs and lie on her bed for a while , but instead she headed for the basement .
cooking was another thing mom did too much of , for a woman of seventy - fivea woman of seventy - five worn out by years of raising a grand - daughter tully when sometimes for months or years at a time she had nt even known where the childs mother was , or whether sugar was even still alive .
even though sugar was doing so much better now , and was so much less dangerous to moms well - being , you could nt get the years or the energy back .
he was planning a visit , tullys brother - uncle , and he was the other member of the family who still held a lot of anger , was still suspicious of sugar and the changes shed apparently made .
and he wo nt bring them with him , tully guessed , because he and rachel do nt trust sugar .
they all knew they were going to lose sugar .
has sugar earned that ?
i know what sugar looks like when she s hiding something .
mom went , her movements still suggesting anger , and tully thought she was nt really angry with david for not wanting to bring rachel and the kids , or with sugar for hiding something .
here , ill make room , sugar said .
but sugar had already moved , so tully sat down beside her the way they had earlier and they watched the screen together , while a stream of local and national and international events washed over them , seeming largely unimportant right now .
she never would have shared a couch with sugar in her teens , because sugar would either have been half - unconscious and snoring in a drug - induced sleep or bouncing around erratic and wired and not making any sense , stinking of tobacco smoke and worse .
she never would have shared a couch with sugar in her teens , because sugar would either have been half - unconscious and snoring in a drug - induced sleep or bouncing around erratic and wired and not making any sense , stinking of tobacco smoke and worse .
but tully did nt know , and she thought sugar did nt really expect her to .
tully had been nine years old at that time , while sugar herself had been twenty - three .
tully was nt cute anymore , by then , and anyhow sugar barely knew her .
twenty - seven years ago , though , sugar had ached and ached and ached for zack , who still had been cute , at three , and whom she missed like breathingor , no , like heroinbut she could nt confess to patty or walter or anyone that shed had another child .
tully asked , as she and sugar walked slowly from the doctors office to the car .
tully had stayed in the waiting room during the appointment , because sugar had said she preferred to see the oncologist on her own .
halfway home , her cell phone played blake sheltons austin and sugar gave one of her dark , jazz singer laughs .
at the sound of the name , tully did nt even try not to prick up her ears , but sugar finished the call very quickly without her short phrases giving anything away , leaving tully still in the dark .
tully could almost feel sugar thinking , feel her like a coiled spring .
i said his name on the phone , sugar realized .
not from any profound realization on sugars part about that day , because apparently shed totally forgotten the spilled coffee and the spilled history , the stained dress and the ruined night .
i m not dropping you at ren fletchers , sugar , she said .
more silence , then sugar said in a strained voice , okay , you re right .
probably not , sugar answered meekly .
okay , sugar repeated meekly .
tully was a good , steady driver who kept to the speed limit and did all the right things such as looking in her mirrors before she changed lanes , but right now sugar wanted to scream at her or grab the wheel .
relax , sugar told herself .
tully might have a younger brother , although sugar did nt want to spill this particular bombshell of information just yet .
listen , if i came on too strong back there , tully said , because sugar had seemed so quiet and fragile for the rest of the journey .
but sugar said , no .
if this mysterious visit to ren was going to involve bad news , then she wanted to make it better for sugar , with her own support .
if it involved good news , was she actually starting to feel as if sugar deserved it ?
sugar was shaky on her feet , and then they had to wait a few minutes in the very attractive reception area , and she looked so tired and strung out and nervous that tully almost ducked down to copper mountain chocolates to buy a whole bag of hazelnut clusters , since they d succeeded in bringing sugars energy level back up , last week .
sugar was shaky on her feet , and then they had to wait a few minutes in the very attractive reception area , and she looked so tired and strung out and nervous that tully almost ducked down to copper mountain chocolates to buy a whole bag of hazelnut clusters , since they d succeeded in bringing sugars energy level back up , last week .
she was on the point of asking the office manager how long the wait might be , and if it was going to be more than two minutes she really would go to the candy store , and then force - feed sugar like a mother bird feeding a shut - eyed , featherless baby .
tully grabbed onto her to keep her steady , and sugar grabbed back and they hugged .
he gave a professional smile , as tully and sugar let each other go , and he looked shockingly good .
he shook sugars hand , too , but she apologized for the damp of her palm , holding it out .
oh , right , sugar said .
your son , sugar ?
i ca nt tell you , sugar whispered .
and yet sugar still did nt want mom to know .
neither ren nor sugar had mentioned how old he was , but if he was a final year surgical resident she guessed he must be about thirty or thirty - one , five or six years her junior .
at some point during those turbulent years when sugar had come and gone from the morgan family home , shed given birth to another child , one shed never mentioned , not one word , and whom shed given up .
tully tried to work out the timing , based on when sugar had been around and when she had nt , but the dates were hazy in her head .
tully wished they were still down in his office so they could just make a polite excuse and go home , but really sugar was nt in a fit state for that , anyhow .
she needed to sit and rest a little longer and have some nourishment , even if it was just the empty calories in sugar - laced coffee and cookies .
ren had come over now , bringing mugs on a tray , along with a small carton of milk and sugar poured hastily from a packet into a glass tumbler .
i could even call her and suggest we get together sugar drank her coffee , holding her hands around the mug as if clinging to it for support .
it was nt the first evidence this past week that sugar had a sense of humor now that she was clean , but still it was unexpected .
a phone call , then , sugar decided .
she and sugar sipped their coffee , and ren finally broke a soon - to - be - awkward silence by asking , are you in town for long , tully ?
if she had nt responded to moms need for help with sugar , how long would it have been before she would have heard this startling piece of news ?
out in the street , sugar needed to hang on to tullys arm as they walked the few doors down to the candy store .
sage would be bound to ask a few friendly questions , which sugar might blurt out hasty answers to , and tully was nt ready to let anyone else in town know about her birth mothers long lost son , or any other morgan family secret .
i think we should support the local industry , sugar said very seriously , looking down at the immaculate offerings .
as soon as they d left the store , sugar said in a pained way , you must have a thousand questions , tully .
but sugar heard the words , even though tully had nt said them .
all her life , shed given nothing back to sugar .
they d punished each other at every interaction , sugar with her confronting and dangerous lifestyle , tully with her blank wall of open hostility and dislike .
now sugar was reaching out .
even now , there was the lingering suspicion that she was being manipulated in some way , and she was afraid , too , of how angry she might be with this fragile woman , her mother , if sugar told her too much .
wherever , sugar said .
so they drove there , and sugar did nt really talk , which gave tully ten minutes to think about neve and kira shepherd and their parents .
tully parked at one end of the lot and turned to sugar .
they were shut away together in the warm little cocoon that sugar had wanted , but the gearshift lever kept them separate and got in the way .
i kept him until he was three and a half , sugar said .
if i did nt have a clean diaper , sugar was saying , while the marietta river rushed in front of them , i left him in the same one for two or three days , or else i fished an old one out of the trash and put it back on , if it was better than the one he was already wearing .
she wondered if she should feel angry , the way sugar was convinced mom was going to be .
who is merc , sugar ?
i do nt want to go to a salon , sugar told her mother .
the last thing sugar wanted was to sit somewhere like that , listening to a lot of cozy gossip that would shift , as soon as she left the place , into gossip about her .
oh , you have backed me right into a corner as usual , sugar .
she fussed around , neat and well - meaning in the way she tidied the magazines on the coffee table that sugar had been reading this morning .
her behavior reminded sugar of all the reasons shed rebelled the second shed hit puberty at twelve .
patty still drove her crazy that way sometimes , no matter how much sugar understood now that this kind of life was worth a million times more than the life shed actually lived , with her quest for the dark glitter .
he kept talking , but sugar barely took it in .
put it off as long as possible , sugar .
patty wanted the detail , and sugar straight up lied about it , which she was pretty good at , after years of practice .
tully looked away from the drugstore shelf shed been browsing in search of some items for sugar .
in each category , there seemed to be multiple options , and sugar had nt given her any detail about preferred brands , apart from saying that mom had suggested golden mahogany for the hair color .
it was six days since tully and sugar had seen dads smile in the face of the nice - looking young man on the park hospital website on rens computer , and ren had called yesterday afternoon with some news , while tully was out running .
the lawyer says hell call again when he s heard back from charlie about possible dates for a visit , sugar had said , but i want to go to new york .
tully really did nt think that sugar was strong enough to go , but she understood the fear that time might be short .
she did nt want to talk to ruth about sugar .
it was a mix of memories about the kind of gossip they d enjoyed in school , an ingrained privacy on the subject of sugar , and an awareness of rens presence in the background of her life that tully was nt letting herself think about very much .
she felt that in many ways she would have preferred the same open dislike shed felt for sugar , back in her teens , rather than this more veiled version that both she and ruth were pretending not to feel .
ren had express - mailed him copies of the paperwork that sugar had , including her own birth certificate and one for zachary charles morgan .
sugar still insisted that she wanted to go to new york , since charlie apparently did nt know when he might manage to get out here , and tully not only thought that sugar was nt well enough to go , she thought that any plan for a visit was putting the cart way before the horse , with mom still completely in the dark .

mom had said again to tully just after lunch , while sugar was taking a nap , what is it that s on her mind ?
i want you to tell her , sugar , she repeated now , more forcefully .
as if sugar had ever done that !
your eyes are nt stinging , sugar ?
sugar sipped her coffee and nibbled her cake and did nt say a word about charlie , and tully felt her anger growing .
but sugar made a face that said , in my own time , okay ?
impressive , sugar .
thirty - seven years later , sugar did nt think pattys reaction would be much different , even if the anger had a different source .
those quizzes assumed that if people were brave in one situation , they d be brave in another , but sugar did nt think this was true .
she was such a sweet , good person , but she could be roused to anger , sugar knew all too well .
dig you own grave , sugar , the gesture might have said .
go after her , sugar begged tully .
as soon as she saw sugar she said with deceptive calm , get back in the bathroom .
i m still processing this , sugar , and yes i m mad .
yay , you re mad at me , too , sugar sang back at her .
correction , starting the dough , going the whole hog , using granulated yeast , because if the dough was fresh and yeasty and good , sugar would eat more than she would eat if it was only a frozen base , and if sugar ate more , then shed keep some weight on , and be stronger , and live longer .

mom was getting exhausted looking after sugar on her own , she said , which is why i came home .
he has to work for quite a lot of it , but that s okay because i m sure sugar will need to rest , and anyhow i imagine it could be pretty uncomfortable seeing him for long stretches at a time when we do nt know each other .
last week , sugar and tully had browsed the clothing boutique on main street for a couple of new outfits that would work for new york in march draped , colorful things that hid how skinny she was .
tully was paying for their hotel room , which charlie had booked for them , and sugar had been feeling proud about that , in a weird way .
dressing herself and putting her toiletries in a plastic bag , sugar had to sit on her bed and rest more than once before she was done .
tully had kept telling her she could nt , that it was too much , and as always , when sugar was told she could nt do something , she got stubborn and went way too far the other way to prove that she could .
tully had sat at her laptop last week , poised to make the final commitment on the airline tickets and asked , are you sure , sugar ?
she clung to the idea that if she just kept breathing she would be fine , her strength would come back by the time she had to climb out of the car , and when she felt it slow to a stop and heard tully say , sugar ?
i wo nt be long , tully promised , when sugar was settled with the two bags beside her , on a bench inside the terminal .
tully left again , and sugar tried not to slump down too far until tully was out of sight through the automatic doors , in case she turned around .
she did turn around , right at the last moment , and sugar lifted her hundred - ton - weight of a hand and curled her fingers in a little wave .
by four oclock , sugar was home .
call charlie , sugar reminded tully , once she was in bed .
they d exchanged a few stilted words last week , after sugar had called him with details of their plans and their hotel .
tully ambushed her with a big hug , long and warm , because they d been short with each other too often , lately , over this whole thing with sugar and charlie , and neither of them wanted that .
this is not how i thought it was going to be , mom said into her shoulder , when you came back , i thought it would be me convincing you and sugar to get along with each other better .
she added more seriously , look , sugar is resting and i ve convinced mom to veg out in front of the tv , which she never usually does , and she really needs it .
mom is tired , after a lifetime of dealing with all the crap sugar pulls .
patty , sugar , tully and charlie .
nobody in marietta knew the truth about herself and sugar , but maybe ren was the right person to tell .
the thing is the big thing is sugar is nt really my sister .
talking about sugar meant they were nt looking at each other with such fiercely restrained need .
he knows , and that s weird , but sugar thought it was pointless to pretend to him , so we did nt .
and i was buying candy for sugar .
and sugar and i have bonded over chocolate .
i d found out the truth about who sugar was , and i just could nt face the evening , the kids , my friends , you .
even if i d been waiting there for you when the cars came , even if we d had our evening together , it would have been ruined by what sugar spilled that day .
it felt as if we were on the same side , he and i , because he d always hated sugar , too .
he looked shocked at the suddenness of it , and she said quickly , not because of what we ve talked about , sugar and ruth .
how s sugar ?
he was wondering what he was supposed to know about her real relationship to sugar .
they were just about to eat when they heard sugar coming slowly down the stairs .
you can call me sugar .
and when she left marietta , she would be leaving because the saga of sugars illness would be over , and that was too hard to think about right now , when she and sugar were just starting to find something together .
and when she left marietta , she would be leaving because the saga of sugars illness would be over , and that was too hard to think about right now , when she and sugar were just starting to find something together .
tully had said she would let herself in quietly , and she did , but sugar was awake anyhow , and so was patty , sugar thought .
she went into the kitchen , and sugar heard the pipes clunk as if tully was washing her hands or getting a glass of water , or maybe boiling the kettle for some hot tea .
the old sugar , twenty , thirty , thirty - five years ago , would have scorned such a simple pleasure , but this sugar knew better .
the old sugar , twenty , thirty , thirty - five years ago , would have scorned such a simple pleasure , but this sugar knew better .
that nagging had led to sugar leaving home around then in an act of petty , cruel , and thoughtless defiance , for a jagged , strung - out , three - month trip to chicago with a carload full of out of control kidsan episode punctuated by screaming phone calls to her mother .
something that had nt even got going before prom night and that they missed out on all those years ago , but somehow its still there , and so help me , sugar if i mess it up again .
so patty went out into the hall and met tully at the top of the stairs , and sugar heard them having a short conversation , then she could tell by the footsteps that it was tully going down for the juice , while mom went back into her room , to bed .
mom interpreted those creeping entrances in the early hours of the morning as generosity on tullys partthat she wanted to be home to help sugar get up and shower and dress in the mornings , help with her breakfast and her medication .
but they all pretended it was for sugar .
last week , for example , tully had barely seen him , because shed been too busy taking care of sugar .
annette was taking very good care of sugar , jumping up at one point to find a mohair blanket for her knees because she looked cold , concerned that she might be sitting in a draft .
i want pictures of sugar with all of us !
in explanation to patty , sugar and tully she added , kiras exs ex is a figure skating coach at the rink , and i m just going to come right out and say it .
but if there was a list of unlooked - for joys that tully had discovered since shed come home to marietta , the thing the fling with ren would be at the very top if itabove the blossoming warmth in her relationship with sugar , above the scary possibility of someday having a new brother to love , above even the magical mysteries of copper mountain chocolatesalthough admittedly that last one was close .
trying to walk quietly so that her footsteps did nt distract himshe had nt realized he could hear , down thereshe put the strawberries back in the fridge next to the champagne , put the matches for lighting the candles in a drawer , picked up her purse , and let herself out of the apartment , to go home and have irish stew with sugar and mom .
i probably do nt need to ask sugar , ren said .
she did nt even want to think about it , and spoil this beautiful day together , but it hurt in her gut anyway , a dull , fierce kind of ache like the one sugar described when her meds were nt doing their job .
making her peace with sugar had changed something inside her .
one of the nicer things sugar did for me , in the early days .
finally , though , they went for coffee together with one of pattys old friends , and sugar told them she did nt want to come , thanks , if that was okay , and that shed be fine watching tv with things like tissues and snacks and a glass of juice within reachand anyhow , if she needed something else , like the bathroom , she could actually get there herself , even if she was slow .
like tully , he was successful at itthe way you could , if you wanted , consider that sugar had been successful in her former career choice of whacked - out druggy street hooker .
he had his own practice , with a receptionist to answer the phonewhich she didbut then she would nt put sugar through .
i m his sister , sugar explained .
ii have the dates for his visit , now , and i ve already told you , sugar , i m not bringing them , he cut in .
silence , then , i m at work , sugar .
i must have been crazy , sugar decided .
mom ended a five - minute monologue on the subject of what grocery shopping would need to be done and what rooms she would put everyone in , by rushing out of the room to check the linen closet in case they did nt have enough sets of spare sheets , and tully took advantage of her absence , blocking sugars view of the tv and saying at once , with her voice dropped , sugar , i can understand why you wanted this , and i guess i m glad its happening .
you ll be here to help , sugar reminded her .
sugar took what she now recognized as a vanilla mango truffle , while tully picked up a pear and ginger swirl .
you know it , sugar .
for a moment , sugar thought about bluffing her way through , but then she just did nt have the strength .
tully put the piece of candy in her mouth , and sugar did the same .
watching her read through it , sugar looked embarrassed and apologetic .
tully and mom were still keeping up the relentless roster of healthy meals , but if sugar wanted the between meals indulgence , let her have it .
they re not for me , sugar said .
but this was a distraction , and sugar waved it away quickly .
she was nt sure what david and rachel would think , whether they might imagine it was payback , or emotional blackmail , but she was nt going to turn sugar away from the idea on that account .
she prompted gently after a few seconds , when sugar did nt continue .
he hugged sugar , his arms light and gentle around her because he could see at a glance how fragile she was .
he was your first contact , sugar explained , unnecessarily , and the two men stepped closer to shake hands .
like sugar , tully had pored over the pictures he d sent , and shed mulled over every detail sugar had given her about the years when shed had him with her .
like sugar , tully had pored over the pictures he d sent , and shed mulled over every detail sugar had given her about the years when shed had him with her .
he d loved fire trucks , sugar said .
i m glad you re here for this stuff , because sugar and i are of course you are .
she caught up to charlie and sugar , which was nt very difficult .
neither one was going to let sugar do or say the wrong thing , or get too close .
tell him what we have planned , tully , sugar said eagerly .
their progress toward the parking lot had slowed even further , but it was too late to suggest that sugar wait while they brought the truck around .
he was holding the front passenger door for sugar , and he took her elbow .
he threw an unsmiling glance toward the porch where they stood , and mom did the predictable morgan female thing and began to cry , just as sugar and tully had , at the airport .
he came up the steps , leaving sugar to be helped by ren .
sugar kept forgetting to pick up her fork again to eat , and tully kept prompting her , but in the end she gave up on that and leaned across the table to say quietly instead , do you want to bail , sugar ?
sugar kept forgetting to pick up her fork again to eat , and tully kept prompting her , but in the end she gave up on that and leaned across the table to say quietly instead , do you want to bail , sugar ?
i m sorry , sugar apologized .
at the table , as tully and sugar left the room , hannah said to ren , can you please tell me about my pony i m going to ride tomorrow , mr . fletcher ?
you call her sugar .
so they had to talk about all of thatabout why patty was still mom to tully , about how things were getting so much better than they d been for all those years before sugar got clean .
david arrived with their two mugs of coffee on a tray , along with milk and sugar .
she needed to be home , helping mom and sugar , making sure rachel did nt feel she should be preparing breakfast for everyone .
tully knew that she and mom had been letting things drift with sugar .
she could nt afford to mix those two things uplosing sugar , and losing ren .
when sugar was ready to let go of this world , tully could nt keep on willing her to stay here so that she herself could remain in this special place and time , this interlude of unexpected love .
i d thought maybe sugar and charlie would nt want to come .
or that rachel would take some time out for herself , but then as soon as sugar said she was coming , i knew rachel would want to be there to keep an eye on everything .
as far as mom , sugar , david , rachel , charlie , and the kids were concerned , it was fine , but she was dreading the afternoon on her own behalf , dreading seeing ren .
ii think so , sugar said .
and for sugar , tully knew , it was especially wonderful that charlies memory was a happy one .
they were gone all morning , while david and mom and sugar and tully and charlie sat around talking , with a candy box on the coffee table and an old movie running in the background .
tully had seen so many movies with sugar over the past few months .
easier to wait , but this reminded her too much of the old sugar finding excuse after excuse to keep on using .
i think he s a keeper , tully , sugar whispered to her , about ren , on the way back to the car .
tully would take david , sugar and charlie in her own car .
she said to sugar , charlie and david .
go for it , sugar said , and charlie and david both nodded and said it was fine .
they helped sugar sit in the front passenger seat and david said , toss me your keys , tully , then i can open the windows for some air .
i ve come to really respect sugar , and to care for her oh , you have ?
and sugar has beenyouve shown me , the way you act toward her , that its possible to forget and let go of the past .
no , it was grief and bereavement , as much of a loss as the one the morgan family would soon experience when they lost sugar .
i m the only one who s noticed , sugar decided , sneaking another look at tully .
there were seven of them gathered here , seven precious people , eight if you counted ren , but sugar was the only one who d noticed how much tully was pretending .
patty , looking the way sugar felttired but happy .
shh , no , its fine , sugar soothed her .
hey , we had the whole conversation and i did nt have to say a word , tully joked , but her voice was tight in her throat , sugar could hear it .
and that s not where he is , in his own life , sugar knew .
no one had noticed the short , infinitely precious heart - to - heart between sugar and her daughter .
chapter twenty - six sugar looked dangerously close to a collapse .
is this okay , sugar ?
the lighting is so harsh there sugar , i do nt think that s what you should be thinking about , right now .
and if i wake up in the morning sugar , of course you re going to wake up in the morning .
goodnight , sugar , ren said .
she spent fifteen minutes helping sugar with her night routine , and when she went back down , the lighting was low and there was music playing , just as sugar had asked for .

to watch him lean over the table to get his three helpings of sugar , his strong arms straining through his sweater , made her weak at the knees .

` ` i want to be inside you , sugar . ''
` ` sugar , are you sure ?
` ` coffee , cream and sugar . ''
` ` open , '' he demanded , placing a pastry with cinnamon and brown sugar right in front of her mouth .
a few minutes later , she brought out the steaming mugs , along with sugar and cream , and some homemade cookies she 'd baked the other night out of boredom .
` ` sugar and cream ? ''
working quietly , samantha handed him a cup before she sprinkled a little sugar in her coffee .
no use sugar coating the situation .
he 'd bet he was the only one who knew how she took her coffee - no sugar , two creams - or what color sheets were on her bed - hunter green .
` ` if they can bring it with some soft butter , golden raisins , and brown sugar , i can make it taste the same as it did when i was eight years old .
tipping back her head , she gazed at stars flung like powdered sugar over the night sky .
but i meant , do you like it black or with sugar ?
` ` he honestly believes sugar is evil and i should give it up for my own good .
so she 'd confront him while she was angry and on a sugar high .
` ` maybe so , but we can both enjoy it without worrying about consequences other than a sugar high . ''
not only was she harboring the wolf , but she was compounding her foolishness by snacking on sugar .
but god , when her lips come apart , everything turns warm and her sugar sweet breath is in my mouth , and i probably taste like hot dogs but i do n't care .
once , i made the mistake of asking him if he wanted sugar .
you get any sweeter and i 'll get a sugar rush . ''
thirdly , after my sugar rush , we worked out .
when i went to add sugar to nox 's , he shook his head and grinned , ` ` sweet tea 's for pussies , babe . ''
then she eyed her son as she said , ` ` pass me the sugar , sugar .
then she eyed her son as she said , ` ` pass me the sugar , sugar .
the royal theater rises up from the concrete like a green and white spun - sugar confection , its roof adorned with a lyre and crown .
buckwheat , honey , sugar , lard .
she opens her coat and pulls out a large jar full of white sugar .
the man stares at it ; sugar is like gold dust now .
` ` that was a lot of sugar , '' vera says quietly as mama walks past her .
a bag of onions , a half a bottle of sunflower oil , some oil cakes , a nearly empty jar of honey , two jars of pickles , three potatoes , and the last of the sugar .
people who will kill for a gram of butter or a spoonful of sugar .
` ` after the migraine , she turns into a sugar fiend . ''
i had my own coffee , loaded up with cream and sugar , which was sitting ignored in front of me .
` ` it was either that or sugar in your gas tank . ''
` ` that 's not how it works , sugar . ''
` ` why that girl put a cup of sugar into the water reservoir , i do n't know .
` ` flip over for me , sugar . ''
i reach for my own bucket of sugar and alcohol and take a few gulps of liquid courage .
his voice is warm milk and burnt sugar and rum - soaked ladyfingers with hot fudge sauce and an invitation to spend a weekend on martha 's vineyard on the beach without clothes or other people .
` ` the kind with the crusted sugar on the edge , all spiral sliced , and then she makes the sweet potatoes with little marshmallows ... '' my stomach growls .
` ` it 's not like you need the sugar . ''
i go to the bank of sinks to wash off the sugar .
turns out your sugar daddy was n't so sweet after all . ''
` ` i 'll have a coffee , black with one sugar . ''
dawn and sophie then started to add sugar and milk to her cup .
` ` oh no , too much sugar , '' sophie said .
` ` problems , sugar ? ''
` ` hi , sugar . ''
` ` sugar cookies .
grogue was a sugar cane liquor drunk with honey that flowed freely here .
she stirred sugar into her coffee .
` ` my mom liked to decorate sugar cookies , but my brother , dylan , and i were n't all that into it .
he opted for a mug of fresh local ginger tea and one of the christmas sugar cookies instead and leaned against the bar , staring out over the water as he bit the frosted tree cookie in half .
the sweet natural sugars sent a jolt of energy through her , his words putting her on the defensive .
` ` yeah , sugar ? ''
` ` no sugar coating it .
` ` sugar , you know i only wish i could ' ve done more for you this time and when you were young . ''
holt may fall for that kind of thing - he 's unbelievably soft - hearted , the big sap - but you 're talking to a seasoned professional now , li'l sugar dumplin ' .
faith ivory 's expression probably would have been the same if kit just hit her in the face with , well , a li'l sugar dumplin ' .
you take yours with cream and sugar , if i recall correctly . ''
then she poured them each a cup of tea from the pot , adding three sugar cubes - jeez , they had flowers on them , too - to her own .
miss helen moved two sugar cubes to her cup and stirred gently .
just use the instructions in the book to snag yourself ... you know ... a sugar mommy . ''
what , you thought i was really looking for a sugar mommy ? ''
` ` you wan na be edie 's sugar daddy , you sonofabitch ? ''
as she licked those clean , she used her other hand to add two teaspoons of sugar and a healthy dose of milk to the brew .
before he could explain or apologize , however , she finished pouring and asked , ` ` would you care for cream or sugar ? ''
the kind of home people had in old movies , with white clapboard and black shutters and full - grown sugar maples canopying the front yard .
one where wisteria and morning glory grew lush and fragrant beneath their canopy of sugar maple and oak .
` ` cream , no sugar . ''
you just mix eggs , sugar , milk and cream .
ally asked in a voice coated with artificial sugar .
' hello , sugar . ''
she hated being called sugar , but it appeared to be webb 's favorite endearment .
` ` there 's no need to be so formal , sugar .
` ` you have to be patient , sugar .
` ` i snow , but it 's been a while since- ` ` ` ` listen , sugar , there 's a meeting i need to get to .
he figured brenda hartley 's daughter could spot a sugar daddy as well as , if not better than , her mother .
` ` it 's not a contract yet , sugar . ''
` ` there 's no need to be coy , sugar , '' webb responded .
he liked it strong , with a little sugar and no milk .
seemingly oblivious to his surprise , tamara poured hot water and added just the right amount of sugar to his tea , and then placed sawyer 's cup and saucer on the table next to his plate .
` ` hey , sugar , what can i get for you ? ''
` ` that sounds like a great idea , sugar , '' he said as he placed his hand on her lower back and tugged her even closer .
` ` shh , you 're fine , sugar .
` ` do you like cream and sugar with your tea ? ''
` ` no problem , sugar , '' she said with a wink .
i imagine it will take me a while to grow tired of your sugar , though , honey buns . ''
even as sleepy as timmy was , he obligingly held out his finger to be poked , never even flinching as the nurse stuck him for blood to test his sugar level .
he even tests his own sugar with supervision .
simon swallowed a lump in his throat as he looked at timmy 's sugar level , relieved when it looked fine .
he disposed of the strip and the trash from checking timmy 's sugar and sat down on the boy 's bed .
maddie 's eyes narrowed as she watched kara consume another christmas cookie , and then reached for the plate herself , taking a green frosted sugar cookie with a grimace .
it appeared that they 'd just done a nighttime sugar check on timmy , who was lying down trying to get to sleep .
