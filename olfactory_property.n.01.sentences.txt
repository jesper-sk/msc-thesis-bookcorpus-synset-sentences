she smiled back , her scent of unease melting away from her .
i inhaled deep , deep lungfuls of the soft aroma , trying to get the scent of the garbage out of my nose and mouth .

nearly all the individual scents held some sort of taint , with the exception of two .
tinted goggles were pushed back on both foreheads ; they were identical in looks but i could tell the scents were different .

she inhaled deeply , wanting his taste and his scent embedded into her memory .
he had the feel of her against his body and in his mind , the sound of her voice singing in his ears , the taste of her on his tongue , and the scent of her in his lungs .
her spirit was surrounded by his heat , his scent .
he was overcome by the taste of her , the scent of her .
he was intoxicating her with his sexy voice , with his touch , with his scent .
we need the place cleansed of all scents .
he came hard and long , groaning her name , rubbing his face and torso against her as if to mark her with his scent .
every aspect of his body - his lips , his hands , his scent - suddenly overpowered me .
his lips to her ear , he whispered , ` ` i ache for you - for your body , your scent , the sounds you make when we 're f**king .
like the water in the shower washing dawson 's scent from her skin , it felt like a kind of punishment .
he overwhelmed her senses with his taste , his scent , his touch , and her hormones did a rain dance in hopes of ending the nine - year drought .
she dug the fingers of her free hand into his firm waist and struggled to shut down her knee - weakening , nerve - tingling response to his scent , his heat , the skill of the silken tongue plying hers .
his heat , his scent , his taste , she stored them all away in her memory bank .
the weight of him , scent of him , feel of him surrounded her , impaled her .
it was worth it , to hear her shrieks as he gorged himself on her scent and taste .
it flicked off , the sounds , the images , the scents , and he was back on the grass staring into cybil 's eyes .
reminding himself this could be an act to lure him into her trap , he tried hard to stay detached , tried to ignore her scent , her softness , her heat .
her senses seemed heightened to his textures , his scent , his heat .
she adored his taste , his slick , wet heat , his scent .
no , he would take a few moments to compose himself before heading for the shower , where she always imagined him frantically scrubbing her scent and touch from his bronzed skin .
he merely wagged his tail harder , and when the door opened , he lunged through the widening crack , yipping a little as he trotted around the spacious , two - story great room , checking all the familiar scents before darting into the kitchen and out again , then coming over to hope as if to say , ` ` i ' ve checked things out and everything 's okay . ''
it was damp and the scents of unwashed bodies , urine and blood made his nostrils flare in distaste .
scent of pine .
that his nearness , scent , and touch just brought back the rush of pleasure and exhilaration she felt when he 'd been deep inside her .
he withdrew from her mouth , fighting to get a breath without her scent on it , needing a moment that was n't totally bombarded with the silk of her tongue bathing his cock .
she 'd been inflamed by the feel and scent of jack when she 'd taken him in her mouth , but this position , his gently punishing touch made her aware of the fact that she was a woman and under his control .
he got lost in her eyes , her scent , that sexysoft skin .
she knew that , but the shock and fear crashing through her system , combined with exhaustion and the noxious scents , had her on overload .
he wanted to strip her bare , taste every inch of her skin , lay his scent on her .
as soon as the cli**x slowed , leaving behind languid , liquid satisfaction and his addicting male scent , his gaze locked in on her , steady , open , letting her see forever into his psyche to glimpse his grit , his determination - and the fact that he only wanted her more .
but she supposed it was only natural to feel close to him when his scent and taste still lingered and he laid beside her , watching intently .
scent was all - important to a were , and this woman 's aroma filled him with a longing so deep he lost his place in the conversation he 'd been having with a couple of club members .
he pulled her closer , surrounding her with his heat , his scent , his charisma .
this close to her , he became more aware of her scent , one he 'd reacted to from the moment he 'd walked into the baggage claim area .
hammer challenged , lifting the panties to his nose , then closing his eyes as if savoring her scent .
instead , she was acutely aware of the feel of his body against hers , the scent of him , the heat of his skin .
she loved kissing rome , loved how his tongue and lips made her lose all sense of reality ; when she kissed him , there was nothing but rome 's scent , rome 's taste , rome 's touch in her world , and she loved it .
the taste of jericho , the feel of him , the scent of him , it enveloped her , and she was gloriously , deliriously happy .
does that scent make you think of anything ... evocative ? ''
the steady throb made him burn to kiss her right there , to taste her , inhale her scent .
he would have recognized her taste , her scent , her fingers gliding along his jaw .
images , words and scents from their night in vegas came back to her .
you had better be sure , '' he commanded , his mouth an inch from her own , his scent surrounding her , stirring her appetite .
he ran his tongue along her hot folds , drinking in her scent , her heat , her beauty .
` ` your scent makes me want to drown in you . ''
