jean 's skin was freezing , and his breath stunk of flesh rot .
it was the scent of rot and death .
there was an underlying scent of rot hanging in the house , but i did nt consider that anything unusual .
the air , and its not just the air in the bunker but all the air inside and out , smells of rot and decay and disease .
fucking thingsits hard to tell , with the rot and decay of the dead , which corpses are actually dead and which corpses are still undead .
i felt hot breath as he did so and smelled a stench of rot and decay , of ancient ruins and war torn battle fields , of hot fresh bloodan odor that was decidedly notdog .
i lay there , praying she did nt come crawling through it , smelling like rot and decay , a taste for my young tender flesh in her mouth , black drool running between jagged teeth and dripping on the floor with a wet , plinking sound.and when i finally slept , i no longer saw her , but she cackled in my dreams like a mad person whose mind had given way to violence .
