he raised an eyebrow at the leopard - patterned area rug covering the hardwood floor .
there she found joe wiping the area with a towel before glancing up .
sunlight streamed through the two windows on opposite walls , highlighting the soft beige carpet and putting a spotlight on the areas that were indented from the years of heavy furniture and the occasional discoloration from use and wear .

to his eye it looked the same area , but from the tilt of the hull he guessed the ship was actually beginning to narrow here below its midpoint.the space looked larger , an illusion of the much lower ceiling .
he paced back across the camp , torn between resentment of the way greg had allowed printer to double its area overnight , and relief that the overpowering stench of unwashed bodies had been watered down as a result .

this ship is huge we have more deck area per person in the eighth of a deck inside the perimeter than the eleisus had all told when we left sheraton .

they buried him in the twin creeks picnic pavilion area , which was void of any people .
standing near the entrance to the lobby , the man in black was searching the area with a bit of apprehension .

it took us about 15 minutes to walk to our area .
the game was played like chess but with ebens standing on a large square area of the compound .
whilst crossing i looked down and was able to discern strange movements within the oily smoky rings , the movement looked like a summer heat haze rising from a hot surface , looking through these areas it was difficult to focus upon the ground beyond , in fact this ground seemed to move and change , one second grass and foliage could clearly be seen and then a grey , barren , featureless place of what looked like course sand or gravel and then back to the grass again .
i gasped but did nt have time to think more on this because i found myself being pulled uphill towards the village gates , as we ran it seemed that many of the hazy rings were disgorging dark beings onto the grass , all where nightmare creatures with hideous expressions , the only form of garb they each had was a mismatch of various pieces of armour and tattered rags , i had brief glances at helmets that seemed to be missing large pieces , breastplates that only covered a portion of the body , mail that seemed to hang in torn shards about their lower bodies , there skin was grey and wrinkled and in some areas silver grey and no hair was apparent on their bodies .

i walked across to take a look , the parchment coming out was covered in similar characters to those racing across the dark area in front of the other machine .
as i looked at the area of light they seemed to be playing some kind of game with children involving the throwing of a spherical object that the children tried to catch .
following this the image shifted again and a small child appeared throwing a similar spherical object across a large area of short green grass , a small animal that looked like some kind of miniature wolf chased after the object and after returning it to the child dropped the object at his feet .
as we made our way around the base of the hill we came to a sloping area into which great wooden planks had been set to form a great wide stairway in the avenue to the top .
the stairway must have been fifty metres across and it went up to the top level in three stages , this meant that twice on the way up we walked across twenty of so metres of flat area before ascending the next flight of steps .
but then i gasped as retta stopped before the cliff and beckoned tnie forward , as he drew near the rock face another shimmering area showed itself .

hundreds of years before the kulmoog came into fruition , a small group of rebellious lincran townsfolk ( apparently sick and tired of having to walk into the next county in order to legally tie up their horse / horse - like - antiquated - mammal - transportation - thing while they indulged themselves at the tavern / socialization - through - intoxication - establishment ) set in motion plans to acquire an eternally binding clause in which they would control ownership of the parking area of downtown lincra and thus be free to get as intoxicated as possible without having to worry about the long stumble to the horse / horse - like - antiquated - mammal - transportation - thing .
tiny , miniscule bins with wheels had been crafted around the perimeters of the area .
most areas got well over two inches , a very welcome site to many who were nt expecting it .

ken squatted and brushed dust off the area below where the painting ended .
she sat beside a slender young woman , who moved her purse from the area beneath kyras seat and held it in her lap .
karen took sight of her son busily mopping an area near the pantry .
certainly worth checking out , he made a momentary stop near the area where she stood , just to take a hearty guzzle from his bottle of natural spring water .
daren walked in the building and over to the far wall where two sconces illuminated the area .
the distant guard waved back , then turned his back to patrol the area .
my heart fluttered when i scanned the area and saw our break .
occasionally i checked the area , for the most part my attention focused on the door in front of me .
we walked back and forth in our areas , watching the horizon .
stopping at the top of the stairs , he studied the area below .
the area around her grew brighter , shortening her shadow .
it is a beautiful warm evening , the kind of evening to sit and enjoy a glass of wine while reading a book , which is what many of the people around me are doing but i can not join them in their simple pleasure because i am frantically examining the area , trying to find help .
half way down the block , some construction makes the alley narrower by taping off an area where they are replacing the bricks of the sidewalk .
it was a pile of rubble that shifted from place to place , exposing bare brown areas of desk .
as she did , her own light began to illuminate the area around them .
occasionally , reinhouer explained , one could catch a glimpse of objects in the parallax by doing this and focusing on the area centrally in ones altered field of vision .
that area would , obviously , be off limits to me .
it always bothered me that any suitably large area of grass can be called a park .
and feathers from a torn pillow sporadically layered the entire area as if the icing on a cake .
i always tried to proceed with caution into any enclosed area .
finally he slammed over the bump of the sidewalk and down into the sloping tarmac parking area out in front of the stationhouse .
they wandered around the fountain and the area where the students used to study .
two arrows hoisted onto one bow , each with a designated target area on one elk .
large boulders lined the area along the open space .
amaya and her father walked past the area where she and apollo had stopped .
apollo scanned the area across the bridge for sophie .
we covered her with a couple feet of dirt and layered over the area with needles and some wayward leaves and grass .
more than likely , the figures scurrying there now were stockpiling the area with arrows , ensuring that every rooftop had an inexhaustible heap of silver - tipped shafts waiting to be unleashed upon the undead .
there was a black rubber matt on the ground that was perforated to keep the area behind the counter from getting slippery , but desmond still slipped on its greasy surface as he walked over it .
there were craft supplies littering the area from the art class that used this room part of the time and alma shoved the bottles of glue and glitter away .
it was a make out area , and you could see the downtown area of widowsfield from there .
the area rug was green and plain , with a hole in it where a dog had eaten through while chewing on a bone .
( just a thought , but would nt widening his search area help ? )
on the other monitor there was camera angle showing the viewing area .
revealed behind the glass was a large cargo elevator , not dissimilar to the metal walled chamber that had plummeted them both down onto the mining area floor of lunar outpost one , this one though appeared to be a little more internally high - tech with a vast array of colourful glass panels embedded within the steel wall surrounds .
i hurriedly surveyed the area they were steering me toward .
we decided to try to find some sort of security office , thinking that if they had surveillance cameras , we could double check the area outside the mall before making our next move .
we decided that we should check a few floors up for shelter , that way we would have a good vantage point over the surrounding area , but we would nt be so high up that we would have issues getting out .
in their short life the embers disappeared with one final flash , lighting a large area around it .
the kid who found the grasshopper threw it as far as he could out into the grassy area of the playground then ran to meet up with his friends .
their snow - white robes made them stick out from the surrounding area .
` ` total covered area is five square miles . ''
there was no doubt about it ; the grand was the place to be around the dallas / fort worth area .
` ` sit , '' she commands , patting the area next to her .
once we arrive at the same area we were before we rush past it .
despite the number of lights set up , there were still areas of pitch darkness too black to see into , so it was hard to get a clear picture of what was going on .
he once told me that an integral is the area under a curve , hence it implies wholeness , whereas a differential is the measure of how the curve changes at any point .
it was a boggy hollow , in area a little larger than a baseball field .
a large group of people encircled an area by the nurses station , watching as several doctors struggled to get two screaming patients to calm down .
police cruisers , empty and destroyed , filled the area below .
running his hands over the area beside it , lance felt two , thin metal rods that connected together .
they broke through the abundance of tents into a short clearing with police tape cutting off certain areas .
lance let his eyes roam the area around them , trying to see someone who could help .
in the far corner , close to the stadium , a lone light searched the area , catching vladdies in its path .
my brother and i scanned the area as we waited for her to finish .
i scanned the area around me frantically , fearing the worst .
his tone was nonchalant , but i could tell her words were getting to him from the way his gaze scanned the area around us .
i turn to tank and tell him , i have a plan ~~~~~~~~~~~ after taking only a few minutes to dish out the new plan , we go in groups of two and surround as much of the area as we can .
he lowered his head to the area , pressed his hood next to the surface , and saw that it was a face , and an ugly one .
perhaps it was the darkness skewing his perspective or perhaps it was the thudding of his heart drawing blood from his brain , but the area appeared much greater from the middle looking out than it did from the rim looking in .
what she could not see , however , was the area directly ahead of her , the area that seemed to drop beneath the coming rays of sun as though to hide its ugly face .
what she could not see , however , was the area directly ahead of her , the area that seemed to drop beneath the coming rays of sun as though to hide its ugly face .
this whole area would be considered shallow compared with the sections in the sway and the shun .
brine darted his eyes passed them and surveyed the area opposite the interment site .
stopping beside the captain , she made a break in the vines and peaked outside , scanning the area to the left where shed last seen the crawler .
in areas where the grout had come loose , the stone wall seeped , like , this black stringy stuff .
i gave the area around my camper another quick look and then retired for the night , locking my door this time .
when he reached her he turned and looked for the entrance of the temple and all he could see was rock covering the entire area where the entrance was .
as ryan examined the door and the area around it he saw the two sconces on either side of the door .
ryan was a little of an advantage because of the small area between the house and the wall .
jump and you can choose your landing area .
instead , he got down almost on his knees and crouched his way forward to the gravel area surrounding the gate , and checked out both grassy areas either side of it , his face no more than a foot off the ground .
shane scanned the area with his eyes , saw a darkened figure near the end of the row , shuffling slowly toward him .
the first try , though , i punched a hole straight through the vein , and cyrus said he knew so by the black spot that instantly covered the area .
they got his arms , his face , his torso : he was being stretched apart from all directions , his features smearing as his surface area increased .
each unit consisted of an oversized and elongated pan , which allowed a more generous coverage area than conventional units .
taking a thin white towel and patting away the ice and snow from the area , she fumbled to press the tape over the pipe .
* * * hunched over in the grave , harry was using his spade to clear an area to the side of the coffin , which would give him enough space to lever off the lid .
as he walked , he passed from overlooking the city of terem , which took up the majority of the area within the wall , to overlooking the convent , which occupied a corner in the south .
her eyes scanned the area around her again .
he flipped the top flap over and slid two machetes out of the case , their unsharpened areas painted black , but the cutting edges glinting and shining in the sunlight .
the others followed single file , trying to avoid poison ivy and areas where the leaf litter might have been concealing dips and holes in the ground .
he pointed to himself and then pointed to the area in front of them near where the hummer was parked .
the dumpy woman , who had been out of view , moved back into it , her rotund frame blotting out the visible area behind her .
the fan sprung into life and began to oscillate , sweeping the area in forced air .
every nook and cranny , everywhere it was dark , stood out sharply , but when her eyes passed over areas where there was normal light , her vision shimmered uncertainly .
not only did it overwhelm the defenses at the armory in crescent city , it also completely drowned the entire area .
a suggestion to strafe the area is dismissed , it would not do well to attract any more attention than the whirring rotors already would be .
a security light lit up the area behind the house , and they were finally able to see better .
for a moment , her flashlight lit up the area beyond the steps along the front of the house .
the tip of the neck caught on the rim , shattering the bottle and spraying tiny shards of glass around the area .
his ` ` clearing '' was really no more than a slight hole in the area .
i measured how deep the zombies were around our fence and the total area they took up .
i counted the density of the zombies over a ten - foot by ten - foot region and then extrapolated the number in 10 square feet over the total area of zombies around us .
they hit areas where artificial light can be seen from above .
each time my foot came down , the vampires head moved a little further away from its body , and the area beneath my foot got thinner .
the floor was covered in a rotting elegant area rug .
the narrator said that if one took the area of the triangle and placed it in just about any random same - sized place of any ocean or sea the world over , the number of disappearances would be roughly equal .
tomas heard a click and the area within the doorway was suddenly infused in a deep , red glow .
the whole area was awash in mud , right up to the top of the concrete and extending out to the tips of his boots where he stood .
she brought the sponge back to the sink and cleaned the area again , including the bucket shed fished out from underneath to counter to clean the drip line , finally watching the last of the pinkish water swirl away down the drain .
i think if i increase my surface area against the rock then i will be able to stay on it for longer !
but there are some doors and areas she had nt drawn on her lipstick map .
all the cards worked off a personal area network .
they stood looking at the entrance to the bay area rapid transit , or bart , station .
peculiarly , the tangle of corridors seemed to cover an area far greater than the visible surface part of the building itself .
i flipped through the pages and found an area that had a whole section scratched out .
the office looked as though a massacre had taken place as pools of the liquid spectacled and in some areas , covered large sections of the floor .
one area he found interesting was the forgotten cemetery - located just off the road to his left .
the bas - relief was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five by six inches in area ; obviously of modern origin .
there are , no doubt , circumstances in the case which seem peculiar , the finding of the dead man in the area of herbert 's house , for instance , and the extraordinary opinion of the physician as to the cause of death ; but , after all , it is conceivable that the facts may be explained in a straightforward manner .
now its area ?
keeping with tradition , i dialed her number as i pulled my rig off towards the parking area of this stop off .
tiny blue pins covered areas she had cleared .
most of the area was blocked by the building , but i could see that was the area he was referring to .
i do nt know what happened , if i looked away , if the path twisted more sharply than i d realized and for a moment the area where they sat was blocked by the corner of the building , but when i arrived at the spot where the path dissolved into the lawn , i looked at the bench and it was empty .
he sat dejected , his legs spread apart , his hands dangling between them , his eyes fixed on the small area of floor in front of him .
the problem was since nearly half the fence was beyond the scooter 's range , or in areas too impassable to visit , he never noticed the three separate sections which had fallen down to varying degrees over the years .
one night after many frustrating hours of deliberation and fear , he took a water hose and sprayed the area around all the cameras .
in the minutes that passed , a few cars passed the area of damaged guardrail .
michael bent down to closely examine the area of the burn .
ash broke eye contact , and pretended to scan the area behind the captain for enemies , or anything else .
douglas had said that the stones were there to help rainfall drain by adding more surface area or something or other .
this simple act increased the area that they had covered when the rain came , and they collected what they could into the water barrels .
he walked carefully down the steps of mem gym , keeping his eyes averted from the area where the burned zombies were .
i placed a small amount on a dry area of the tunnel floor .
even by torchlight , he felt he was passing by areas he 'd seen dozens of times .
then a shadow blackened the area where i stood and i turned to see the monster .
he slipped back below the hill and pulled a notebook and pencil from his pack and began sketching out the dig site from his new perspective , noting the tents and the irregular shape of the excavation area .
i checked the area behind the cars again , and walked forward .
it allowed a view of the drive itself , and an area of about 25 feet on either side , though it was virtually impassable beyond the drive .
as i was leaving , a large area of the floor caught my eye where the wood floor had faded nearly white .
he lay down beneath the tree and watched the dealers sell to the junkies and the families that were either unobservant or ignorant to all that was going on around them , walking around and playing in the grassy areas .
the paper reported : ` ` the scene was a nightmare under glaring spotlights as stretcher - bearers raced back and forth between their ambulances and the victims who were strewn across an area of a hundred square yards . ''
a mortar shell lobbed into a supply area , two men killed , one man - me - lucky .
the viet cong lookout swooped above the slide area .
yet those bones and old dreams call to him like troubled voices from his childhood , like the ghost of every unfulfilled ambition he has ever held , and he knows even z then that he is n't going to turn the china shaft meekly over to the company and the federal pricks without at least one look inside for himself he instructs turner , who is bitterly disappointed but not really argumentative ( he understands about msha as well as ripton ... maybe , as a blast - monkey , even better ) , to have yellow restricted area tapes placed across the opening .
between these latter two buildings was the dusty police - cruiser , driver 's door open , front - seat area plastered with collie entragian 's blood .
the caddy , s rear window was even tougher because its area was smaller .
there was even dirt left over , in spite of what the wind had whipped away , because of the area displaced by the cadillac .
the flashlights have mostly stayed over the wedge area .
henry imagined a sign , big red letters reading biohazard area !
there was a pressed - down area in the snow that almost made the shape of a human body .
i tried to get annmarie from bay area private nursing , but she 's out on a call , and ... can you come , edgar ?
she saw big yellow schoolbuses with the words charter search party in the destination windows pulling into parking areas all along the western maine part of the appalachian trail .
